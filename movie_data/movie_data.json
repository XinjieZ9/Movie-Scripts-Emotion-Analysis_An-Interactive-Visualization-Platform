            "**Loved the first Ghost Rider, this one was TERRIBLE**\r\n\r\nTo be honest, i was really looking forward to see this movie, the trailer itself was eye-candy and highly exaggerated.The story is as bad as the actors' performance. Nicholas Cage is going a very , very bad road, his lasts movies , ''season of the witch'' and ''drive angry'' were as thin and dreadful as this one. The action in this movie was unjustified and plain crazy bad, the way ''Blaze'' was written, the laughable dialogues and dumb facial expression of Cage didn't helped at all. The 3D effect on this movie is overrated, everything is too much and fake. Idris Elba was probably the only reason why i went to watch this but even then his role was thin and futile, On the whole, it's messy , funny and plain bad, i pray to god there is not a third one",
            "Christ what kind of bum did they get to write and/or produce this one.\r\n\r\nI really, really liked the first Ghost Rider movie. This one is nowhere near that one. Sure, Nicolas Cage is doing Johnny Blaze again and they even got Christopher Lambert to play an old priest but the movie is just poorly implemented. The Ghost Rider is actually not really appearing that much and when he does, the special effects look cheap and not at all as cool as in the first movie.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t help that, when he first appears in the movie, he gets shot down by a simple \u201chuman\u201d gun and ends up in hospital. This nonsense about, first trying to hide out in some obscure place a \u2019la The Hulk (been there done that), and then trying to get rid of his powers and afterwards taking on Satan without them is just ruining the fun. The film totally lacks the spirit of the first one.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I\u2019m rather disappointed. It\u2019s really a shame that they screwed this one so badly because now we probably won\u2019t get another one even though they made a lame attempt at the end of the film to leave a door open for that.",
            "_**Wild sequel**_\r\n\r\nThe first Ghost Rider film from 2007 was fairly faithful to the comic. When Ghost Rider came out in 1972 it was more of a general idea than a fully fleshed-out premise. This was clear as the stories changed from writer to writer and one artist to another. Ideas were added as the years progressed, like the \"penance stare\" and Blaze's growing awareness of the former angel of justice, Zarathos. The book was canceled in 1983 after a ten-year run. In 1990 a new version of Ghost Rider was introduced with a different character and it ran eight years.\r\n\r\nThe first film was an amalgam of the ideas presented in these two series, mostly the first, and struck me as the comic-book come to life. Really, the only thing that was disappointing was the villain, Blackheart, who was seriously scary in the comics, but not so much in the movie.\r\n\r\n\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" (2012) is a worthy follow-up with Nicolas Cage returning as Johnny Blaze. The story switches to Europe and, more specifically, Romania and Turkey, where the film was shot.\r\n\r\nThis time the devil is played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, rather than Peter Fonda, which isn't a big deal considering Satan could presumably take different physical forms. The devil's main minion is played by Johnny Whitworth, a different character than Blackheart from the original, albeit similar. The hot female is Violante Placido, who's arguably an improvement over Eva Mendes. Another positive is the rockin' soundtrack.\r\n\r\nI don't mind the story switching to eastern Europe since the locations are excellent, particularly the amazing cave-monastery, but there are other changes that I'm not so crazy about, like the charred biker jacket of the Ghost Rider, but this is just a matter of taste; I simply prefer the cool biker \"costume\" as opposed to the dirtbag biker look. A more significant negative is the overactive camera that's annoying and draws attention to itself (hopefully this fad has run its course). But there are enough dramatic parts to balance out the quick-edited thrills; besides, you get used to it\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a quality sequel that interestingly fleshes out the nature of the spirit that possesses Johnny blaze (I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it). People who claim the film's more \"serious\" and \"faithful\" to the comic are off the mark. It has the same quasi-serious, cartoony-horror vibe as the first film, with glimpses of humor. As radical as the first movie was (in a comic booky way), this one ups the ante and is the better for it. Unfortunately it's marred by the hyperactive camera and quick editing.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",
            "**It's better to forget this movie.**\r\n\r\nAs I said before, in the review I wrote for \u201cGhost Rider\u201d, I'm not a fan or even an expert in comics, so I'll ignore the source material and focus on the movie. I'm not the right person to say whether or not it's a reliable adaptation. However, I can already say that it is a bad movie. With all its weaknesses, the first film was a work of art when compared to this unfortunate piece.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that it's a sequel designed to make money. Producers and studios didn't even bother to try to disguise their greed, and rubbed their hands at the good box office obtained. Poorly received by critics, the target of numerous criticisms from the public, but a relative success at the box office, the initial film paved the way for this sequel, which wouldn't be bad if it was a good sequel. Unfortunately, almost the entire cast and crew of the first film (except for Nicolas Cage) is absent from this project, which adopts a totally different visual and dramatic language from the previous film and, thus, cuts any hypothetical continuity.\r\n\r\nThe script is mediocre and is based on a fight between Johnny Blaze and especially powerful evil forces that want to kidnap a child, supposedly the son of the Devil, key-figure to Armageddon. Simple, extremely clich\u00e9d, very poorly crafted and poorly developed, it's a script worthy of a 70's B-movie. All the dense atmosphere and something sinister we saw in the initial film is totally absent, having been replaced by something lighter, \"hard rock\" and eventually designed for young adults and teenagers aspiring to be rockers. The fast pace with which everything happens favors the logical flaws, which appear in the script with the magnificence of Baroque palaces, being impossible to ignore them: the case of the monks, with medieval robes and caves coexisting with high-tech devices, weapons that would suffice for Ukraine for a year, and wine capable of getting half the Russian troops drunk, is one of the most egregious. I'd rather not talk about the ability to decompose objects and food that one of the characters will acquire at the end, and that seem to work only when it's convenient for the film.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage is still present in the film, but he is the only one from the previous cast to do so, since all the others, especially Eva Mendes and Peter Fonda, dropped out of the project after reading the script. Smart decision. Cage, if not brilliant in the first film, is mediocre in the sequel, with a one-dimensional, apathetic and sleepy interpretation. Ciar\u00e1n Hinds is doing well and doing a great job and very worthy, but he doesn't have much to do, while Violante Placido and Idris Elba, despite their efforts and some good moments, don't make more than an average effort.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film bets massively on CGI, of great visual and dramatic effect, with the flames and the whole apparatus around the Rider reaching hyperbolic levels. The mine scenes are perhaps the most obvious example of what I'm saying: enough bullets for a military battle, fire everywhere, that huge machine... everything taken to the extreme for visual grandeur and spectacularity. It sometimes worked, there's no denying it, but it often feels like something out of a computer game. Set in an area of \u200b\u200bCentral Europe, the film was partially shot in Romania and makes good use of the beauty of the chosen locations. The sets and costumes are decent given the script and location, and the soundtrack is heavy, tiresome and uninteresting. Worse, however, are the sound effects used, as they are often clearly fake.",
            "Like the First one, this film can't find its footing. Johnny Blaze is also kind of Dan Ketch and the Ghost Rider spirit is kind of both Blaze's and Ketch's possessions.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn't work. It's pulled in two directions in character and because of that it can never find its footing. Like the old Indian saying \"If you chase two rabbits you'll lose them both\"\r\n\r\nThe franchise would have benefited if they chose ONE of the stories to tell, ONE of the Ghost Riders to portray. Pick Blaze, pick Ketch, it wouldn't have mattered, but two characters as fundamentally different as they are, dealing with two completely different demons meshing them together just loses focus on the story.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond that, what you have left is too much CGI.\r\n\r\nIt could have been a much better film if it chose a direction. It didn't, and the story never landed because of it.",
            "Not any where close to being as good as the first. At least it still has Nicholas Cage. He's the only one from part one in this movie. It's just an ok movie.",

            "Fabulous action movie. Lots of interesting characters. They don't make many movies like this. The whole movie from start to finish was entertaining I'm looking forward to seeing it again. I definitely recommend seeing it.",
            "Good action movie with a decent script for the genre. The photography is really good too but, in the end, it is quite repeating itself from beginning to end and the stormy OST is exhausting.",
            "Awesome movie!  WITNESS ME will stick with me forever!",
            "Fantastic action that makes up for some plot holes.",
            "Wonderful action movie. Scenes are unimaginable. Lots of graphics used in this movie. This is totally a very good action movie.",
            "I was never a fan of the original Mad Max films but this one just blew me away. There was something so powerfully visceral about this on the big screen. It was a fun on assault on the sense , in a good way. Its spectacle rather than plot driven so may not fare as well on the smaller screen. Watch on the largest possible tv in a darkened room with the phone and other gadgets off. Crank up the volume.",
            "I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.\r\n\r\nIt is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of \u201cwhat the f\u2026\u201d feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.\r\n\r\nWhat I think was my largest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!\r\n\r\nStill it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.",
            "**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2015.**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll keep this\u2019n somewhat brief, because I only saw the movie once and it was a few days ago now. Some time later on though, I will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. For now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _Mad Max: Fury Road_!\r\n\r\nThe number one complaint I\u2019ve been seeing about _Fury Road_ is that there\u2019s not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. The plot isn\u2019t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it\u2019s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, _John Wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of _Fury Road_ is something else entirely, I can see why people aren\u2019t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. _Fury Road_ is more of an \u201cexperience\u201d than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it\u2019s one of only five films I\u2019ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don\u2019t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _Mad Max_ franchise is worth it.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",
            "1 Star, solely for the fleeting Presence of the Interceptor. As for the rest, Nothing to do with Mad Max, just a cross country jaunt of constant silly action. \r\nAs a Fan of the Original, Mel Gibson is Mad Max, an there will be no other. I have no idea what was going through anyones mind when they tried to tie this to the Mad Max Franchise, Probably not much. If the movie had just been called Fury Road, left Mad Max out of it, It may have been an interesting movie in its owb right, but I think it would have been laughed at and relegated to the $1.99 bin at your local service station.",
            "When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was \"Every critic has lost their minds... even me.\"\r\n\r\nThe story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. After all these years later he's still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. You are the man Miller!\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn't as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn't talk all that much, I mean most of he's lines are \"huh\", or \"Water\", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.\r\n\r\nCharlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's Furiosa right here.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.\r\n\r\nImmortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.\r\n\r\nThe other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That's why I got to give this movie praise for that.\r\n\r\nNow for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn't find anything that I thought wasn't good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Forget \"Pitch Perfect 2\", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say \"Now that, was one heck of a movie.\"",
            "George Miller brings us the fourth Mad Max film - Ultimate Carmageddon!\r\n\r\nAn apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and most everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller directs and co-writes the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. It stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Josh Helman and Nathan Jones. Music is by Tom Holkenborg and cinematography by John Seale.\r\n\r\nWell it was a long time in the making, but finally a fourth Mad Max movie was made and it proves to be worth the wait. Undeniably light on plot, this essentially is a two hour chase movie played out to an apocalyptic backdrop of green skies, scorched orange and red vistas and the sort of storms that usually only come in nightmares. \r\n\r\nHundreds of crazily designed vehicles do untold damage to each other and to the barely human contingent - both goodies and baddies, the weaponary on show is vast and brutal, while the stunt work is breath taking. There's some narative stabs at redemptive force between Furiosa (Theron excellent) and Max (Hardy rightly restrained), but really this about high octane action and it's absolutely thrilling as Miller's camera work rarely sits still and brings all the carnage vividly to life.\r\n\r\nA petrol head's love poem in live action form and an action junkie's wet dream, Mad Max is back, and this time there's also a glorious female side-kick of considerable tough substance. 9/10",
            "**Mad Max: Fury Road\u2019s magnificent effects, editing, cinematography, and directing make it a film unmatched in almost every way.**\r\n\r\nMad Max: Fury Road floods every second of its 2-hour runtime with frenetic chaos, massive practical effects, and unparalleled mastery. George Miller produced an action movie on a scale, unlike anything I have ever seen. The effects were almost all practical, giving the movie a grit and realism that most films never reach due to the overuse of computer-generated effects. The budget for this movie had to be insane because the cost to make all these vehicles and explosions and crashes had to be astronomical! And so worth every penny. This movie is enrapturing and stunning! Mad Max: Fury Road personifies madness from the frantic camerawork to the editing style to Tom Hardy\u2019s wild-eyed performance making this film intense, heart-pounding, and unpredictable. The world-building and screenplay are genius as well. The story doesn\u2019t get caught up in explaining everything but instead throws the audience into the middle of this insane post-apocalyptic world, making them feel the same chaos as the characters on the screen. I could go on and on, but plain and simple - Mad Max: Fury Road is an action masterpiece that is worth seeing over and over again.",
            "Without a doubt the franchise's best work thus far.\r\n\r\n<em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> starts off perfectly good, though the movie properly clicks into gear when the characters of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron join forces. From then on it's entertaining and I certainly enjoyed watching it all unfold. The action remains super effective and visually epic, the stunt work really is fantastic.\r\n\r\nHardy and Theron put in convincing showings, definitely an improvement on anything from the original trilogy in terms of the acting talent; no disrespect to those from the first three, it's just a noticeable upgrade for me. With all that noted, I still don't think the characters in these films are as strong as they could/should be (but still good) - and that's what probably stops me from utterly loving this.\r\n\r\nA prequel with Anya Taylor-Joy portraying Charlize Theron's character sounds great on paper, so I'm very much up for checking out <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em> at some point soon!"

            "The young \"Furiosa\" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing \"Dementus\" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her \"Little D\"! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The \"Immortan Joe\" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the \"Guardian of Gastown\" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the \"Bullet Farm\" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement \"Dementus\" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with \"Joe\" but only if he trades his \"Little D\" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver \"Praeteorian Jack\" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of \"Smeg\", \"Rictus Erectus\" and \"Scrotus\" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2\u00bd hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",
            "Whilst Furiosa isn't a bad action film, I suspect its lacklustre response from audiences, reflects not whats on offer but whats absent. \r\n\r\nOn the upside is loads of heart stopping action, amazing cinematic's, great sets, plus strong performances from the cast.\r\n\r\nA lesser aspect of the downside is the unnecessarily drawn out back story, replete with details about the key character, no one cares about, which, in turn, leads to the main fault in this film.......ITS NOT ABOUT MAD MAX Rockatansky.\r\n\r\nLets be honest, no one's really interested in peripheral characters or their back story, they want the REAL DEAL. That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.\r\n\r\nIf this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. \r\n\r\nIn summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that. I'm amazed this wasn't obvious.",
            "I enjoyed <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em>, which is a rightful addition to the <em>'Mad Max'</em> franchise.\r\n\r\nI personally would say that the run time is way too long, like this does not need to be a 2hr 20min+ movie. With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.\r\n\r\nVisually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",
            "I really enjoyed this film! It is _a lot_ of explosions and brutality, but it was continually compelling \u2014 even as I questioned why I was so invested. At 2h20m it definitely made me feel my sleepy age (I saw it on my 39th birthday, and I was squinting and yawning by the end!) but I felt more impressed that a relatively slow paced film gripped me for so long.\r\n\r\nIt's a proper odyssey, with poor Furiosa only wanting to get home; but the trials she faces grow organically out of the plot and the universe, and give Furiosa a depth I didn't expect from a character/actor who's almost entirely expressionless through the film.\r\n\r\nThis entry in the Mad Max continuum (though I've only watched [the first](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9659-mad-max), and [Fury Road](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road)) steers away from exploring the whats and whys of the apocalyptic world they live in, tempting though I'm sure it was in a 2024 that has _so many_ parallels, and instead lets us draw our own conclusions. The men in power who lie and rabble-rouse to get the power they desire, just so they can watch the world burn (again); how much we all embrace making ourselves vulnerable for the hope of human connection; the power dynamics and game theory in a world where two thirds of what you need is only necessary because of collective attitudes.\r\n\r\nI'm certain I'll watch this again\u2014and as a stand-alone film\u2014which, for a long and relatively simple plot, is something very uncommon for me. I hope you enjoy it too!\r\n\r\n(Originally posted on [byJP](https://www.byjp.me/posts/reviews/movies/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/))",
            "Yeah, Furiosa. What a furious young lady. Thor does a good job. Well executed lore and world building. Sure does suck to be a lady in this wasteland. Fun to see education breakdown. Didn't even mind the runtime so maybe it should be a 10.",
            "This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don\u2019t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn\u2019t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.\r\n\r\nWhile 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn\u2019t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa\u2019s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",
            "**Wonder Woman **\r\n\r\nLately, it seems Hollywood has been casting great actresses in strong female roles but pairing them with subpar writing. This movie is not one of those. I went in with the mindset of \"here we go again,\" but came out surprisingly satisfied. The story, acting, and action are all top-notch, and it seamlessly leads into \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" without missing a beat. Don't skip this one\u2014it's probably the best in the franchise.",
            "There\u2019s no doubt that \u201cFuriosa\u201d is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller\u2018s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as \u201cFury Road.\u201d Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn\u2019t love it.\r\n\r\nAs the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It\u2019s a prequel to \u201cFury Road,\u201d and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa\u2019s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.\r\n\r\nThe second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they\u2019re executed with Miller\u2019s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that \u201cFury Road\u201d set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts\u2026even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn\u2019t quite pushed as far as it could\u2019ve been.\r\n\r\nThe brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan\u2018s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can\u2019t quite compensate for the weaker elements \u2014 although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren\u2019t going to care.\r\n\r\n\u201cFuriosa\u201d is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn\u2019t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with \u201cFury Road.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",
            "Some decent action sequences as expected though, from my memory, doesn't come close to the epic chaos from Fury Road. The acting for the most part was fine and Chris Hemsworth seemed to be having some fun in his villain role while Anya Taylor-Joy was fine as Furiosa. However, having this coming out 9 years after Fury Road and a spin-off of a character that frankly I had little interest in, was the downfall of this prequel. Beyond that, the plot itself wasn't enthralling and at times I was pretty bored.\r\n\r\nI wish we got an actual Mad Max: Fury Road sequel with Tom Hardy; why they went this route is puzzling, but not to mention taking so long to get it out. It's not too surprising this bombed at the box office and was the death nail of the franchise. **2.75/5**",
            "George Miller definitely had it him to make it epic.\r\n\r\nI hadn't seen Fury Road since it came out, so I took the liberty to watch it and finish it an hour before I went to go see Furiosa, and personally, I liked Furiosa more. \r\n\r\nThe antagonist felt a lot more connected to the plot and the world building was better, you were able to get more of a scope of the world. \r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy is one of my favorite actresses, everything she's in is good and this is no exception. \r\n\r\nThe cinematography of this movie was also more creative.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback for me was that the vehicle designs did not seem as special as Fury Road's. They just seemed like the basic motorcycles and 18 wheelers, which isn't that bad, it's just a little sad.\r\n\r\nOverall a great watch, better than any of the fast and furious movies for sure.\r\n\r\nMangoMeter:\r\n8/10",
            "I do not know if I expected another woke Hollywood turd and therefore was really positively surprised or if the movie is just really good but, to me, this is a really good movie.\r\n\r\nI had heard rumblings about it being bad but, again too me, that is just not true. It is also claimed that it didn\u2019t do as well as expected at the box office but then this is oftentimes clueless Hollywood bean counters with unrealistic and overinflated expectations causing this.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of action filled, crazy and fairly violent movie that you would expect from a Mad Max movie.\r\n\r\nThe action is good, the characters are good, the settings are good (the Bullet Farm was mostly a whole in the ground and a bit underwhelming though), and the story is actually not bad at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no woke, far left preaching that I could notice in the movie which in todays world is a great plus.\r\n\r\nOverall I really liked the movie and its two and a half hour run length did not really feel too long.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something it would be that they just skipped over the war between Dementus and Immortan Joe with some bla bla about humans always having fought wars.\r\n\r\nThe movie also felt a bit \u201csanitized\u201d, that is lacking grittiness and gore, for being a Mad Max movie. The R rating that it apparently got in the US is pretty ridiculous. In France it got a 13+ rating.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is minor nitpicking.",
            "\"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" is enjoyable enough and George Miller is an amazing director, but the film is overlong and it does have a tendency to meander too much of the time. It is basically nothing more than a high octane succession of action scenes at its core, but don't get yourself too excited by the prospect of this. The scenes in question lack the raw excitement of the original trilogy and this is principally because most of the action is obviously taking place in the comfortable security of the studio. This is disappointing, especially when compared to the downright reckless derring-do of the original films where the absolutely superb stunt teams risked life and limb in pursuit of the imaginative and timeless sequences they captured on film for our enjoyment back in the hazardous days where health and safety precautions barely existed at all whereas today the most serious injury you are apt to receive is when your harness suddenly goes a little crazy and bounces you off the nearest green screen."

            "Out of all the films nominated for best picture, there is one that isn\u2019t getting much attention at all. In Hacksaw Ridge, the narrative surrounding the film doesn\u2019t have much to do the film at all because it\u2019s identity seems to be centered on Mel Gibson\u2019s comeback.\r\n\r\nRead More: https://reviews.boxofficebuz.com/review/hacksaw-ridge",
            "I first saw Hacksaw Ridge, back in November when it first came out.. Went to an afternoon screening and it was packed. From the very first scene to the last , I was in awe. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a 5 minute standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",
            "**On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.**\r\n\r\nThe film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",
            "Most of these men don't believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe. \r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",
            "***Tribute to a real-life WW2 \u201cconscientious collaborator\u201d*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss\u2019 potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding \u201cPlatoon\u201d (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn\u2019t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one\u2019s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren\u2019t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple \u2013 throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They\u2019re wrong. Sometimes it\u2019s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",
            "**A really good movie, which only lacks in some details.**\r\n\r\nThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, \u201cWe Were Soldiers\u201d, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond.\r\n\r\nSon of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light.\r\n\r\nThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit clich\u00e9, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor.\r\n\r\nIn general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more.",
            "I don't want to say that I dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, I mean he's been in plenty of movies that I love... but like Clint Eastwood, he makes a FAR better director than he ever made an actor.\r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is just one of those films where he does a great job... unfortunately it is Mel Gibson, so it's over-the-top carnage that is not at all underplayed. But you can't fault Gibson for making a Gibson film, you should really know as much coming in.\r\n\r\nAnd he actually got Andre Garfield to act, which might not win him a reward, but it certainly should, that is a something that could get a man canonized... and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years. He seems like a real actor in this, accent and all.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, it's the story of a pacifist who went to war to save lives... and in the end that's pretty noble by the strictest definition and you feel it though out, which is probably the point... despite the over-the-top carnage."

The Accountant's numbers just add up!**\r\n\r\nThe Accountant was an unexpected action thriller with unique character choices. Ben Affleck's Chris Wolff is a highly capable and efficient hitman with high functioning autism that leads a double life as a forensic accountant-not a typical main character in an action movie and is handled brilliantly well. However, the true highlight of this movie is the writing making each moment and character feel fresh and memorable. Fantastic action sequences and an outstanding cast, along with the exceptional writing, elevates The Accountant well above average action flicks to a special must-see action standout.",

The fight scenes, the camera work, the writing, the acting, and the twists, were all incredibly well done! Upgrade blends sci-fi, action, mystery, and thriller with moments of horror and humor, producing one EXCELLENT film with twists and turns I never saw coming. Logan Marshall-Green's performance grounds the far-fetched concept in reality with charm, and Leigh Whannell is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. I can't say enough about this one. One of the best movies of the past five years with a little bit of something for everyone.",
            "_Upgrade_ is a visually appealing cyberpunk story with plenty of twists and turns. From the beginning, I was pretty hooked. The setup for this film is done so well, I was really into it. Visually, this movie is a treat. So many creative shots made the film feel fresh and fast paced. The combat is brutal and the way the choreography was crafted in conjunction with the diverse camera angles made each fight feel real and visceral. The plot was really well done, although I could not help but feel a lot of the main story points were taken from Ex Machina, but there is enough diversity that it still feels original. The ending was pretty predictable, but despite that it was still incredibly fun to get there. Overall, I had a great time with this film. It was a fast paced and brutal experience which I am one hundred percent here for.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _85%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_"

Its essentially, every stale, second rate, US military action flick, you have ever seen with Australians and New Zealanders, in the lead.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, a film loaded down with tired pro US sentiment that's thoroughly unoriginal.

            "When a group of kids get together under the thumb of the rather odious \"Hayley\" (Zoe Terakes) they are presented with a ceramic hand - that apparently encases a real one - that acts as a portal to a dimension in which live the dead. They have discovered that no harm can be done if they stick to a time limit, exceed that - and well they are in virgin and potentially perilous territory. Following on from her best friend \"Jade\" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to \"Mia\" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young \"Riley\" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle. There's too much dialogue and it's very very score-heavy which did annoy after a while, but it's at times quite scary and definitely worth a watch around Halloween on the telly.",

Many victims around but why Ray and Emma only focused to rescue his daughter (Blake) alone, but Ray is living as rescuers, the film tends to be lacking in the delivery of its humanitarian message.",
            "Lots of rocks everywhere...\r\n\r\nIt's CGI destruction time as Dwayne Johnson battles earthquakes and a tsunami to go rescue his daughter - with estranged wife in tow of course.\r\n\r\nDisaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing more than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden dialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a remake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with the time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side Johnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what is a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10",
            "I have never been a fan of the Disaster genre, I don't seem to be able to take much more away from it than visual noise. I was hoping that the combined might of Alexandra Daddario and The Rock would be enough to turn me around on _San Andreas_, alas, it was not to be.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._",
            "This is a classical Hollywood movie, thin plot and a lot of effects. However, this time, I quite liked it. Actually I liked it a lot. The plot, although thin, is not altogether bad, it holds together even though are quite a few unbelievable moments. However, put in the context of a traditional disaster movie, it is not bad.. Maybe this is what I like about the movie. It is really a good old fashioned disaster movie.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read the blurb about this movie I was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a \u201cslow\u201d search for Ray\u2019s daughter. It is nothing of the kind. It has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes \u2026 and then it continues. I was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but I was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. The special effects are not however. At least, I liked them. Not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. I also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when Ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. I found that quite cool. There are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. For instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. The we have when Ray and his wife speeds through the waters of Los Angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. The amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. But then, I think I am too much of an engineer now.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ray\u2019s wife. That was one of the things I really did not like with the movie. Maybe the movie directors and actors in Hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a \u201cstandard\u201d plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other \u201cordinary\u201d people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the US apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from Hollywood all the time) and I really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and TV-shows! I was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and I do like \u201cThe Rock\u201d.\r\n\r\nSo after, after that little outburst, I have to say that I this one was a really enjoyable movie. One of the few lately that I have watched. It is a quite good, classical, disaster movie with a good build up, really good effects and a good and happy ending (for the main characters at last) and I am a sucker for happy endings.",
            "Solid enough, if not overly long, disaster movie. Dwayne Johnson is... well Dwayne Johnson but has more than enough charisma to carry this and never a bad thing having BOTH Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario either. Some of the effects were pretty good, others a bit iffy however. Still, I enjoy these disaster movies and while it doesn't measure up to The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno, but entertaining nonetheless. **3.5/5**"

The best description for him is a false prophet, at least the most apt description of him is a false prophet... and that isn't a relatable protagonist.

In fact, all the acting was pretty great.",
            "To be fair to Baz Luhrmann, this is actually quite a difficult story to adapt for the big screen. On the face of it, there are many contradictions right from the start (not least that our relatively normal narrator - trader \"Nick\" (Tobey Maguire) lives next door to the eponymous and enigmatic millionaire (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his Disney-esque castle). The story is told by way of a retrospective during which the now depressed \"Nick\" regales his psychiatrist with his tales of life in the fast lane that offered him the opportunity to mix with the rich and famous at the very end of the 1920s through his new neighbour. Simultaneously, he must cope with the unhappy marriage between his cousin \"Daisy\" (Carey Mulligan) and her selfish, womanising, husband - of old wealth - \"Tom\" (Joel Edgerton). The film starkly contrasts the wealth and profligacy of the \"Gatsby\" existence with those of the poverty stricken working class reeling, still, from the impact of the Great Depression. The film looks beautiful. The costumes and the dancing, the cars, the jewellery and the houses (fancy and less so) all add richness to the story and the performances - especially from DiCaprio, Edgerton and to a lesser extent Jason Clarke are really quite good. Maguire and Mulligan less so and I found that unlike in many other of his films, the use of a contemporaneous soundtrack whilst all are clad in the Upstate NY finery didn't work so well for me. The book is an interesting character study looking at just about everything from wealth and privilege to prostitution and mental illness - and for the most part this stays on track. Easily the best cinema adaptation of a flawed book - and well worth watching.",

            "Robert Heinlein\u2019s classic short story \u2018All You Zombies\u2019 gets the big screen treatment as the basis for the Science Fiction time travel thriller \u2018Predestination\u2019, a notably imaginative film noir that craftily elevates the genre into an alluring confection. Australian cinematic siblings the Spierig Brothers (as in Michael and Peter) dutifully direct and adapt Heinlein\u2019s Science Fiction material into a twisty tale of search and suspense. It was reported that Heinlein wrote his intriguing narrative in one single day back in the late 1950s. Well, whatever the case is behind such speculation, it is clear that \u2018Predestination\u2019 is a competent and compelling time travel vehicle that deserves its inevitable comparison to the likes of Rian Johnon\u2019s solid and involving 2012 inventive spectacle \u2018Looper\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe Spierig Brothers and \u2018Predestination\u2019 lead Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated for \u2018Training Day\u2019 and \u2018Boyhood\u2019) collaborate once again as they bring together a surreal movie experience detailing with the agenda of a Temporal Agent going undercover as a barkeep known as The Bartender (Hawke) in an attempt to thwart criminal activities before they turn into actual crimes. It is worth noting that the Spierigs have coveted the zombies/vampires sensationalism in their earlier films (\u2018Undead\u2019 and \u2018Daybreakers\u2019) but curiously side-swipe any references to these creatures in \u2018Predestination\u2019 despite the aforementioned \u2018All You Zombies\u2019 blueprint for inspiration. Perhaps this is a wise revelation as the Spierigs are allowed to concentrate on the ponderous SF aspects of human adventure within the varied dimensions of time, place and space.\r\n\r\nThe daring exposition gels both creatively and caustically because of the macabre mission being undertaken by the Bartender and feminine targeted scriber \u2018The Unmarried Mother\u2019 (as portrayed by Aussie actress Sarah Snook, \u2018Jessabelle\u2019). The agent Bartender is represented by a shadowy and roguish governmental outfit blessed with the ability to fight crime through time-traveling tactics. Unfortunately, the rough edges in preventing crime-ridden hedonism through time travel accessibility has not always been a smooth transition for the Agency. Also, it does not help that the constant policing corruption has spiraled out of control thus adding more pressure to the Agency to perform its watchdog duties tackling sinister plots.\r\n\r\nThere are revolving elements that shape \u2018Predestination\u2019 to become this enigmatic, head-scratching puzzle where the sense of encountering warped worlds are wondrous yet unsettling and weird. The Bartender (already a victimized and distressed pawn in the nefarious dealings of the id-70s New York City\u2019s elusive and crazed Fizzle Bomber) soon encounters a stranger betting him that he (or \u2018she\u2019 in certain cases) can provide the most outlandish story that he has ever heard to date. Soon the boastful stranger (Snook), a \u2018True Confessions\u2019 columnist for the written piece \u2018The Unmarried Mother\u2019, will figure into the Bartender\u2019s predestined existence in more ways than one.\r\n\r\n\u2018Predestination\u2019 is a complicated SF sideshow that touched upon some unconventional fodder that range from timely commentary pertaining to violence to topical issues of sexuality. The film skillfully presents the frailties of suspicion, apprehension and uncertainty within the tangled and playful web of time travel management. With all the nifty under-sized flashy special effects and Science Fiction trickery aside, \u2018Predestination\u2019 sparkles in large part to its committed and calculating performances by Hawke and Snook as the psychological bait that guides the audience into the transfixing insanity that persists within the confines of the storylines. In particular, Snook\u2019s \u2018Mother\u2019 is called upon to offer a complex characterization of an individual (both female and male genders) and take us into the nostalgic timelines of the past and present while conveying shades of toughness, vulnerability and mystique. She has a sordid backstory that unfolds and adds to the tormented trials and tribulations with the obsession of catching the scheming Fizzle Bomber. In a convincing supporting role, Noah Taylor\u2019s Mr. Robertson is instrumental in the development of Snook\u2019s triple identity crisis as Jane/John/\u2019Mother\u2019.\r\n\r\nThere certainly is an old-fashioned, spellbinding vibe about \u2018Predestination\u2019 that propels the Spierigs\u2019 trippy time-traveling spectacle to its climatic ambitions. The low-key production values are surprisingly engaging but overall the telling proof of acting, directing, writing and imagination seems to be a winning formula in conception. Of course, the other filmmaking strokes involving the crisp cinematography, soothing score and vibrant set designs further compliments this punchy actioner.\r\n\r\nDark, moody and visibly challenging, 'Predestination\u2019 gleefully plots and twists its way into a hearty submission of inspired Science Fiction contemplation. After all, time does not stand still for anybody especially in the realm of Australian noir SF sensibilities.\r\n\r\nPredestination (2014)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions\r\n\r\n1 hr.  37 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor\r\n\r\nDirected by: Michael and Peter Spierig\r\n\r\nRated: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Time Travel thriller/Sci-Fi crime caper\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of four stars)",
            "The one thing that this job has taught me is that truth is stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nOut of Australia, Predestination is directed by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig (who also scores the music). The Spierig's also adapt the screenplay from Robert A. Heinlein's story \"All You Zombies\". It stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Noah Taylor, Christopher Kirby and Madeleine West. Ben Nott is the cinematographer. \r\n\r\nIf we throw up a simple synopsis for this pic, it's about a time travelling agent who goes back in time to stop a killer known as \"The Fizzle Bomber\" - whilst helping a trans-gender man who has just told him a fascinating and emotionally wrought story. But simple is not a word readily associated with the Spierig's deliriously complicated mind meld of a movie. \r\n\r\nThe first half of film is the story being relayed by Snook to Hawke, and then the film spirals into a world of temporal loops and frazzled paradoxes. This demands the utmost attention from the viewer, a piece guaranteed to have you asking tricky questions, and also likely to have you rewinding some scenes for clarity - like I did!\r\n\r\nThis is not an actioner, this is very cerebral and sedate in tone, adult science fiction that's as audacious as it is clever. Snook is quite simply outstanding, the various layers she gives to her characterisations grip with intensity and emotional heart tugs. Hawke once again is reassuringly great - in that how he doesn't need to overact, he recognises the tone needed here, whilst knowing it's wise to let his co-star take the main stage.\r\n\r\nThematically the story blends its dizzying thoughts about time and its impact on the human race, with that of our basic human condition, that of identity.

            "This is a film based on the short story by Robert A Heinlein called All You Zombies. It's a fantastic film with a portrayal of paradoxes and the extent to which they can become convoluted if Time Travel was possible. And when I say Time Travel, I mean with the ability to interfere with the past and future, and not just witness. It's a tough movie to get your head around so be prepared to go back and watch it again. The cast is fantastic. _Ethan Hawke_ delivers as always. But we need to talk about _Sarah Snook_ - man she can act! She's the heart of the film and brings together the first half of the film so convincingly. It's rare that a film based on Time Travel is made without ugly holes in the plot. Predestination is one of those rare ones which is complete in its beginning and end.",
            "Predestination foreordained its paradoxical nature and exploited it with individuality. \u201cWhich came first: the chicken or the egg?\u201d. An evolutionary question, now the setup for many punchlines, that has transcended time itself. The causality dilemma that considers both cause and effect. Infinite regression. Unsolvable. What really shapes a person\u2019s biological anatomy or their metaphorical soul? Evolutionary diversity at birth or the nurturing of our surrounding environment? The aforementioned philosophical paradox is one which The Spierig Brothers held closely to the central plot that, on the surface may befuddle even the most avid sci-fi viewers, but dig somewhat deeper and find that the temporal trajectory is bursting with thematic representation. A time traveller is sent back to 1970s New York to prevent a terrorist, known only as the \u201cFizzle Bomber\u201d, from murdering thousands.\r\n\r\nTo mention certain plot strands, even touching upon their delicate coating, would be to spoil this ingeniously creative film. Therefore, as a precaution, I will not discuss the second half. Including the paradoxical plot twists of conception and death. This is a mind-bending sci-fi tale that purely excels when focussing on the human elements of its characters. Forget about the jarring tonal shift from exquisitely detailed flashback narration to sudden sci-fi extravaganza. Put aside the occasional heavy hand-holding (although justified for the dense concept) that unimaginatively explains the limitations of temporal shifting. Exclude the multitude of entrancing twists that seemingly allow the narrative to crumble towards its inevitable conclusion.\r\n\r\nPredestination works best when it\u2019s exploring the human condition. The drive that constitutes our soul. And a central focal point, but not the sole purpose, of the story is Jane\u2019s gender reassignment into becoming John. A \u201cwoman\u201d valued as intersex. Internalised male organs as well as female. Despite raising transgender issues and justifiably exploring the emotional conflict of such a scenario, it\u2019s never treated as unfamiliar territory. Much like the film in its entirety, it garners an identity. Enhancing accessibility by turning an irrelevant piece of fiction into a relevant transcendental concept. Snook gave an arousing performance of someone undergoing such a procedure. Harnessing female and male acting qualities and nudging them subtly through her performance.\r\n\r\nReturning to the preliminary question though, the eternally talented Hawke offers this dilemma to the prognosticating Snook, who simply replies \u201cThe Rooster\u201d. And yet whilst it was a humorous retort, it maps out the ingenious narrative cohesion that The Spierig Brothers moulded. That intimidating evolutionary deliverance, providing a cathartic allure of inevitability. They masqueraded causality through a simple life story told vividly within the confinements of a cigarette infused bar. Strangely, much like with other labyrinthine features, the second viewing allowed me to sniff out breadcrumbs more clearly. The hidden clues that the Brothers had deliberately positioned to reach the predetermined final destination. Extraordinarily clever.\r\n\r\nThe minuscule runtime should\u2019ve been extended to better build the narrative foundations from the weight of all the mind-blowing twists, but The Spierig Brothers defied genre expectations by pushing a time-orientated story to its limits. The conventional boundaries of storytelling now extended indefinitely, addressing common time travel related issues and exploiting them ingeniously. Intelligence prevails once again.",
            "This movie is quite beautiful to look at, especially the opening sequence, with a very noir aesthetic which really grabbed my attention. The huge exposition dump in the bar early on utterly kills the pace the beginning sets you up to expect. But by the end of the movie, it's obvious that couldn't be avoided. A bit of a mind-bender, and although a little predictable very imaginative and absorbing.",
            "It all starts with a mysterious character setting what looks like a timer, only for something quite unexpected to happen and for that perpetrator to disappear. What's going on? Well, we meet the \"Barkeep\" (Ethan Hawke) who is the ultimate in crime prevention agents. He uses the temporal vortex to travel back and forth through time trying to identify those who commit heinous crimes and either talk them out of it, or just plan thwart their plans. He's been doing this for quite a while thus far, but his final mission might prove to be his most difficult. There's just one criminal who has continually eluded him and it's the \"Unmarried Mother\" (Sarah Snook) that he has to ensnare. Now it does take it's time to get going, but it resists the temptation to use it's time travelling theme to bombard us with different scenarios and timelines and gradually focuses us on quite a characterful study of hunter and quarry with lots of probing dialogue. The effectively intimate location provided by his bar - a sort of \"in vino veritas\" state of affairs works well, too. What's equally clear around half way in that, well, nothing is at all clear. The characterisations blur, the events blur - and that's not the whisky. The plot interweaves their respective chronologies in such a deliberately confusing fashion as to make it impossible to readily discern just who is who or what is what, though at least that does explain why this individual has proven to difficult for \"Barkeep\" to apprehend over the aeons. It has a very simple, industrial, feel to it and though the visuals are quite potent they don't overwhelm the personalities and both Hawke and an impressive Snook deliver a story that I found myself caring about. If you need your cinema to be structured with beginning, middle and end then this probably isn't for you, but if you can let it wash over you then it's quite an intriguing watch."

            "The last of the V8 Interceptors and the battle for gasoline!\r\n\r\nIt's post nuclear war Australia and the precious commodity is gasoline, all the varying degrees of survivors pursue it in anyway they can.\r\n\r\nDirector George Miller is here armed with considerably more cash than was available for the first cult hit offering in the series, and boy does it show as we get more destruction, even more outlandish stunts, and a fully realised apocalyptic vision of the future. It's incredible to note that there is no CGI here, this is pure raw stunt work, the film plays out as a standard good versus evil tale, but it's the realisation of the crash bang wallop sequences that lift it to being one of the most important sci-fi action movies of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe baddies are a seething mass of leather, masks, and mohawks, they scowl as they rape pillage and plunder anything in their path, they will stop at nothing to get the craved gasoline that is so important in this world. The good guys are joined by the road warrior himself, Mad Max Rockatansky, a former police officer who turned to being the angry lone warrior of the road after his wife and child were murdered. Can these honest folk survive the onslaught of the crazed plunderers?.\r\n\r\nWell it's high octane entertainment finding out, and the pace is relentless. The direction is first rate, the scenes are put together with breath taking exhilaration, and the sound mix is incredible for those fortunate enough to own home cinema. Pic may be guilty of having little to no dialogue for the most part, yet it really isn't needed since the story unfolds via the smartly stitched together action sequences. So just strap yourself in and enjoy the ride given to you by a film that's still a benchmark for the genre. 9/10",
            "***Fighting for fuel in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Outback***\r\n\r\nIn the years after a global holocaust, an ex-lawman (Mel Gibson) in remote Australia befriends people at a refinery compound and helps them escape a band of ruthless punk bikers who want their resources. Bruce Spence plays the Gyro Captain while Vernon Wells is on hand as a subordinate leader of the bikers.\r\n\r\n\"The Road Warrior,\u201d aka \u201cMad Max 2\u201d (1981) shows a grim, bleak, brutal future, but it's too comic booky and sometimes goofy to truly disturb because it screams exaggeration. A truly disturbing movie debuted fifteen years earlier, \u201cThe Wild Angels\u201d (1966), which is shocking because it\u2019s realistic rather than cartoonish. But \u201cThe Wild Angels\u201d was an outlaw biker drama whereas \u201cMad Max 2\u201d is an action-packed adventure. There\u2019s a lot of motorhead thrills if that trips your trigger. \r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s an Australian production and avant-garde bordering on surrealism. The protagonist is aloof and laconic while the antagonists are bizarre, even psycho, which makes sense in that people would become a little mad in a desperate post-apocalyptic environment. It\u2019s a strangely detached film about cartoonish people surviving in the wastelands of Australia, but the characters and images are often iconic; and there IS some human interest, like the Gyro Captain\u2019s developing relationship with the cute blonde, the so-called Captain\u2019s Girl (Arkie Whitley). Meanwhile Virginia Hey is striking as the Warrior Woman.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in the Outback of New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",
            "Really great sequel that surpasses the original. While short on character moments, the action sequences were fantastic culminating with an adrenaline-filled finale. All in all highly entertaining with just enough weidness to make it stand out all the more... **4.0/5**",
            "The first film did us the favour of establishing the character, so this time we can cut quickly to the chase. \"Max\" (Mel Gibson) is now a fully fledged drifter. He still has a semblance of decency, comparatively speaking, as he travels the Australian wastelands trying to stay alive and keep himself fuelled. Along the way he meets up with the slightly wacky \"Gyro Captain\" (Bruce Spence) but it's when he encounters a besieged oil facility that things start to hot up. He agrees to try and help them fend off the menacing, mask-wearing, \"Humungus\" (Kjell Nilsson) and his menacing sidekick \"Wez\" (Vernon Wells) who has a distinctly Achilles/Patroclus style relationship with his cute, blonde, friend. These bandits are ruthless, violent, and determined to seize this most precious of assets so \"Max\" proposes to his allies a straight swap - in return for enough gas, he will deliver them a large truck for use to travel to the coast and safety. What follows are a series of quickly paced, perilous escapades that culminate in a cracking chase with what looked very much like the front of a snowplough (in the desert?) playing a crucial role as they try to force their way out. Emil Minty is pretty effective as the aptly named, boomerang-bearing, \"Feral Kid\" and once we see why Spence has his moniker, the whole thing quite literally takes off. This is so much better than the original. The story is much more substantial, it has plenty of gore yes, but there is also some dark humour and Gibson has loads of charisma as his character develops. Director George Miller offers quite a potent lesson to other film makers too - ninety minutes is quite long enough to pack in plenty and keep the attention of the audience.",
            "I got more enjoyment from <em>'Mad Max 2'</em>. It's a good watch!\r\n\r\nEverything felt a bit more fleshed out to me personally. Mel Gibson's titular character is improved, as are his sidekicks and their antagonists. The action is still at the same high level, there's plenty to gain entertainment from in regards to that along with the more amusing aspects; but disappointing to see that the wacky eye bulge gag did not reappear! I will say that final sequence overruns, not a big deal though.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the story is more interesting. It is, in my opinion, much better befitting of the movie's dystopian setting and is, just generally, a more noteworthy watch compared to its predecessor's plot. Gibson puts in another solid showing, as do Bruce Spence and Michael Preston in this entry. Honestly, mind, across these opening two flicks the cast don't really stand out to me all that much - it's all about the action!\r\n\r\nIntrigued to find out what <em>'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'</em> had to offer!"

            "Low budget classic that is now a genre landmark.\r\n\r\nSet somewhere in the future we are privy to a world where the roads are ruled by maniac gangs with souped up cars, and bikers that literally could come from hell. Trying to stop these marauding loons are the overstretched police force who themselves ride in exceptionally fast cars. At the front of this story is Max Rockatansky, a good honest cop trying to hold his own against the chaotic world that is forming around him. After his best friend is burned and left for dead he decides enough is enough and thinks about retiring from the service, but whilst on a vacation with his wife and child things go decidedly bad and Max becomes an avenging force of fury with devastating affect.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating this film I feel it really needs to be put into perspective just how brilliant a job director George Miller did with next to no cash to work with, in fact Miller edited the film in his own bedroom just to emphasise the low-fi nature of the beast. The costumes are excellent, the cast are terrific, with Mel Gibson as Max particularly impressive, and here we have villains to truly fit the word villainous, but it's the stunts and chase sequences that makes this film a rich rewarding experience. The opening ten minutes alone are pure adrenalin pumping genius, but the film as a whole delivers a crash bang wallop punch that has often been imitated since its release, but rarely bettered, and although the heart of the film is a simple revenge story, it grabs your attention and delivers right to the corking finale, 8/10.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Region 2 Users should note that the bargain bucket Mad Max Trilogy flip pack set still contains the foolishly dubbed version of this film, incredibly stupid move from the American distributors.",
            "Though I had only seen the previous installment, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome', which I enjoyed whilst a great many people didn't, with the present sequel earning ten (!?) Oscar nominations, I wanted to catch up on things before seeing the new film at the Cineplex. I was very pleased with this early film in the post-apocalyptic movie category, and can see how and why both it and star Mel Gibson became so successful. Other than Kenneth Anger's experimental film, 'Scorpio Rising', I have never seen a work that so fetishes both cars and the ritual of dressing, either for driving or for war. It's very well directed and suspenseful for a first-timer in Miller, and I'm so glad he's still helming the films of the series 36 years later! All that one has to do to see How To and How Not To Continue a Fine Franchise is compare how both George Miller and George Lucas have done this century. It's sad that they were so short on funds that only Gibson could be fitted with real leather in the film--I think I can rightly assume that money isn't a problem anymore...",

            "For whatever reason, never had seen the original and doesn't disappoint, some good action and gut wrenching scenes defying the rules of killing pets and kids, Mel Gibson is quite good in the role and look forward to checking out the sequels. **3.75/5**",
            "It's not often that these dystopian scenarios ever leave the USA, so it's interesting that this one introduces us to the massive expanse of the Australian desert and to the young policeman \"Max\" (Mel Gibson). His job is pretty thankless - and perilous. He must patrol the remote countryside trying to protect what is left of civilisation from marauding motor cycle gangs who are constantly on the search for fuel - for themselves and for their machines. Things start to boil over when ruthless biker \"Toe-cutter\" (Hugh Keays-Byrne) avenges the death of his leader by killing just about everyone he can find - including the wife and child of the now incandescent \"Max\". What now ensues is a grittily told, quickly paced, tale of violence and vengeance with the erstwhile law officer abandoning any sense of decency he had clung onto and going all out to destroy his enemy. This film ought to be remembered for what it spawned, rather than what it offers by itself. Most of the acting is mediocre, as is the dialogue and after a while the brutality started, for me anyway, to lose potency and become almost comedic. This is certainly ninety minutes of cinema history, but it's really not very good.",
            "The action is stupendous, but the rest is a bit of a drag.\r\n\r\nWhen the attackers be attacking it's all great to watch, like I got a lot of entertainment from seeing Toecutter's gang do their thing; and vice-versa with the MFP, really. However, the film kinda goes through peaks and troughs in switching from the action to the more mundane and the latter parts did bore me a little.\r\n\r\nThe characters of Max and Jessie do act noticeably dumb in bits too, I don't necessarily mind that as the whole movie is silly and all those onscreen chew the heck out of the scenery. But it does get a bit annoying to watch, I can't lie. I do like how much extra the characters act in general, though.\r\n\r\nThe whole 90 minutes of <em>'Mad Max'</em> are over the top completely, but it does fit for the majority. I just wanted wall-to-wall overexuberant action, rather than that sprinkled amongst some fairly dull attempted storytelling. Still, I am looking forward to viewing the sequels/spin-offs, particularly those modern-day releases."

            "> A fight among the gods, for the Egyptian empire.\r\n\r\nI like this director, but this is not his best work. I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAt least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.\r\n\r\nI had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.\r\n\r\nWell composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.\r\n\r\n6/10",

As it stands, it has some very neat design choices... And that's it. That's all it has going for it. Not a single actor seems to care that they're in this movie, the digital effects are hit and miss at best, and the story is sillier than it had to be, yet not as entertaining as it could have been.\r\n\r\nBut yes. Some great designs.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._",
            "Fantasy is very difficult to get right in films.  Audience resistance is quite high, especially when it involves characters with difficult-to-remember names or diverse place names.   Relating to a fantasy world of beasts and magic is often tricky for audiences who may prefer grounded, realistic drama.  There are exceptions though \u2013 the worlds of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings captured public imaginations and the complex mass of stories and themes in Game of Thrones also attracted an audience.\r\nThis fear of fantasy seems to have informed a slightly tentative approach in the writing and direction of Gods of Egypt.  There are plenty of fantastic creatures present ranging from giant, vicious snake like creatures to Minotaurs in all but name, and an array of Egyptian gods.  However, there has been avoidance of any of the cod Shakespearean dialogue that often permeates works of this type and an emphasis more upon realistic dialogue.  This creates a needless tension between the intensity of the innovative visuals and the prosaic words dropping from the actors, a tension that is never resolved as the linear story progresses forwards but never upwards.\r\nThe pleasures with this film arise mostly from the intensity of the visual experience.  Every environment has been precisely designed, full of colour and dimension, looking very different from the landscapes seen in past films based on myth and history.  The benefit of this is that there is always something to attract the eye, from great sky barges to rainbow lit waterfalls and massive monuments.  Like all Alex Proyas\u2019 films the visual ideas add weight and substance that the scripting sometimes fails to.\r\nIt is however that narrative which brings the film down with a series of very deliberate events extrapolated in excessive detail, burdened by actors who at times look deathly uncomfortable in their roles.  Only Geoffrey Rush, in a small but notable part, really excels with so many of the others not able to bring life to the dialogue as they intone in front of ever present green screens.\r\nIn the end it is a pity that such a wonderfully conceived world at the visual level could not have been combined with a compelling story and acting.",
            "When the credits rolled after having watched this movie with my kids I was perplexed. I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie\u2026a lot!\r\n\r\nSure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive \u201cheroes\u201d and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.\r\n\r\nI actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not \u201cethnically correct\u201d. What the f\u2026? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise\u2026\r\n\r\nYes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.\r\n\r\nThe rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called \u201ccritics\u201d. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.\r\n\r\nI would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection.",

This movie, it seemed like it was only CGI.\r\n\r\nAnd not just CGI, but the kind of CGI that looks like a video game.\r\n\r\nIt honestly lost me right away, I gave it about ten minutes and just stopped."

While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.\r\n\r\nAn animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.\r\n\r\nThe latest offering in the series \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.\r\n\r\nRaiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth. Naturally, this is not going to be easy as Shang Tsung (Chin Han); is not willing to follow the rules of the tournament and dispatches his top fighter (Sub Zero (Joe Taslim) to dispatch the champions of Earth before the tournament in a clear violation of the rules in order to ensure total victory.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is solid and very graphic action which contains gore and brutality on a level that almost kept the film from earning an R-rating. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhile the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film. That being said; \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d gives fans a solid adaptation that does not shy away from gore and violence and gives fans the cinematic experience that they have wanted.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEven though I consider myself somewhat of a gamer, I was never the biggest fan of the Mortal Kombat games, probably because I never really knew how to play them. Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.\r\n\r\nThe only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the \"Fatality!\" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled \"YEAH!\".\r\n\r\nI admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From \"Flawless Victory!\" to \"Fatality!\", without forgetting the classic \"Fight!\", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click \"play\" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
            "I liked this more than I should have.  \r\n\r\nI have tried the games, but am not into the fighting genre of games (although the Injustice series grabbed me for its story).  The previous movies were fun and didnt take themselves seriously - which was good, but they got too hammy and over the top.  The last cartoon took itself way to seriously and was disappointing and forgettable to say the least.  \r\n\r\nThis movie, however seemed to grab everything good from the previous attempts, added actors who know some martial arts, used some of the key terms and moves from the games and had a stand out performance from Josh Lawson as Kano adding the 'very dry type of  Australian' humour.  Hell, the score was even good.  \r\n \r\nGiven that this is pretty much the same as the game - 10-12 fights some spectacular fatalities and a basic plot with no character development - this was a very fun way to spend 2 hours.",
            "Fluff entertainment at its most bland. The fighting is pretty forgettable but at least they utilized the R rating for some decent gore that honors the game at least. Acting is at best so-so while the dialogue was pretty bad and it probably 10-15 minutes too long. Can't say I'll remember this but for what it is, it's fine as a time-waster. **2.75/5**",
            "Okay so let's start by saying I wasn't exactly sure what to think going into this movie I didn't know what was going to happen but wow this is one of the best action films of the decade so far yeah it started slow but really was a good full time of excitement",
            "OK LETS start off with if you have not watched the latest animations of mortal kombat this will movie will make you feel abit effy. You will need more background on the actual characters you know from previous movies and those you don't. and the True scorpion and sub zero animation also covers alot. Good fighting movie though. Shouting GET OVER HERE!!!!!!and FINISH HIM haha it makes a person feel like you part of it.",
            "I've played Mortal Kombat since it first came out. I watched the original movies in the theaters. I had high hopes that maybe a reboot would make it feel fresh and maybe establish it as a darker genre like the games are.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace in this film is the Scorpion and Sub-Zero Feud. I felt disconnected from Raiden and Shang Tsung because they were so emotionless and hollow. I did like who they got to play Kabal because I felt like that character was really well-written. I usually don't like Sonya Blade but this movie made me like her. I don't like Liu Kang I never will so it didn't much matter who they cast in that role because that character to me is too generic. I did not care one way or another for Kung Lao or Kano. The guy playing Jax has been the best Jax so far. I hate how they made Milenna look in this one and it just didn't suit the purpose of what her character really is. Goro felt copied and pasted from the original film.\r\n\r\nAll in all this could have been much better but I doubt we get to see anything past this due to how generic and unfeeling this film actually felt. Sad excuse for a Mortal Kombat reboot.",
            "Mortal Kombat is not just too long for a movie based on a fighting video game; it\u2019s actually too dumb to even be a movie based on a fighting video game. On the one hand it does a Resident Evil, introducing a new character and making him the hero, instead of giving this role to an already established character \u2013 preferably one that is, you know, popular among the franchise\u2019s fan base.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand, it dips into the same old MK well, kicking off with the Hanzo Hasashi Family Massacre \u2013 Kombat\u2019s equivalent of the biblical Massacre of the Innocents. Only last year the animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge covered the exact same ground, and did it a lot better. The intertitle that follows the prologue confirms that we are not about to see anything new (Earthrealm blahblahblah Tournament blahblahblah Outworld blahblahblah).\r\n\r\nMK21 contains exactly (sub)zero surprises. The first time we see Jax, we know he is going to lose his original arms and have them replaced with cybernetic prosthetics (the only surprising thing about this is that the character's first replacement arms are quite underwhelming. Jax eventually gets something more in line with what we\u2019re used to; the question is, why does the movie do in three steps what it should do in two?). Similarly, Kano's true, treacherous nature is no secret.\r\n\r\nWe already know all this. We know it like the backs of our hands. If we don't know it from playing the game, we know it from watching the 1995 movie \u2013 speaking of which, MK95 is 10 minutes shorter (it wasted little time with pre-Tournament antics, and it didn\u2019t even bother with a Training Montage; in contrast, MK21 includes what is best described as a tutorial, not the way you want to go about evoking a video game feel), which is to say 10 minutes better. It also had better effects; its Goro was clumsy and awkward \u2013 something like the Cryptkeeper on stereoids \u2013 but when Johnny Cage punched him in the balls, I felt it. Conversely, when Cole (Lewis Tan), the aforementioned brand-new character, fights Goro in MK21, it\u2019s like he\u2019s shadowboxing, and his shadow happens to be a four-armed man-mountain of pixels.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, what\u2019s the point of watching a movie where we can anticipate every important event, and anything we don\u2019t see coming a mile away turns out to be unnecessary? For example, it's cool \u2013 pun intended \u2013 when Sub-Zero makes it hail, but that\u2019s just a gimmick \u2013 nothing more than smoke and mirrors.",

So this should really be her review... because I'm just going to trash it.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is plot, as in they actually tried to add in a real plot. Mortal Kombat is a fighting game. You play it to peacefully beat your friends to a bloody pulp... and that is where the fun is.\r\n\r\nBut they added a plot.\r\n\r\nIn Twister, the star of the show was the tornado. The plot was there to move the view from tornado to tornado. And in Back Draft, it was the same... with fire.\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat thought it had to be deep. It thought it had to be something more than it a tournament. It thought the characters had to have more than surface level depth.\r\n\r\nTHE DIDN'T.\r\n\r\nThe Tournament should have been the star. The plot should have only been there to move you from fight to fight with a climax that shouted \"FATALITY!\" and left it at that.\r\n\r\nInstead they tried to add depth where no depth was needed... and that killed the fun of Mortal Kombat.\r\n\r\nNot every movie needs to have a plot and characters, some movies work best as mindless popcorn munching escapism.",
            "<b>Mortal Kombat shows off some amazing design and stunt work, but the writing keeps it from everything fans wanted it to be. Hopefully, the sequel will learn from these shortcomings.</b>\r\n\r\nI would be lying if I said Mortal Kombat (2021) was everything I had hoped. But I also enjoyed it and hope the sequel does happen someday soon.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><b>Pros:</b>\r\n* The character roster was pretty big for a first outing, and I appreciated seeing so many of my favorites right off the bat.\r\n* The costuming and aesthetics were stunning. I immediately recognized each character because their designs held true to the games while still being updated and modernized. The attention to detail was incredible.\r\n* Josh Lawson surprised, making Kano undoubtedly the most entertaining part of this movie.\r\n* Casting some true martial artists like Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada gave the action more skill and grit.\r\n* The R rating was the right fit for Mortal Kombat, allowing the gore-filled fatalities fans have come to love in the games.\r\n\r\n</blockquote><blockquote><b>Cons:</b>\r\n* With a massive payer of characters to choose from in the Mortal Kombat universe, the addition of Lewis Tan\u2019s Cole Young was unnecessary and annoying. A dozen existing characters could have served as the audience\u2019s perspective.\r\n* Adapting a fantastical and violent video game to a feature film is no simple task. However, Kevin Tancharoen perfectly grounded the Mortal Kombat story while keeping the magic and fantasy roots in Mortal Kombat: Legacy (2011). Unfortunately, Simon McQuoid struggled with that balance, resulting in a script that felt like the CW team wrote.\r\n* The whole Arcana superpower thing stripped the need for skill from some of the fighters, becoming a disappointing dues ex machina. I would have preferred better writing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAll in all, there were more pros than cons, but the cons took what could have been great and made it decent. All the pros give me hope that Mortal Kombat 2 can fix the cons and make a much better sequel. Fingers crossed!",
            "Enjoyed it overall but the story was meh. Loved that they had goro and other characters and that they also alluded to characters like kitana by showing off her fan and stuff. I wish that there was a tournament in the film and they stuck closer to the Mortal kombat story. Cole Young was not a very good character in my opinion."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAs you should know by now, I avoid trailers at all costs, especially for highly anticipated movies. I'm careful enough already, but once I heard the massive complaints about the trailer for The Invisible Man, I made sure to not even listen to it, let alone see something from it. My expectations got higher as the release date approached, and the overwhelmingly positive reactions reached my attention, so obviously, I couldn't help but get excited. I love The Handmaid's Tale, and I always thought it was a matter of time until Elisabeth Moss brought her phenomenal acting skills to the big screen. She just needed a big film to do it...\r\n\r\nAnd this is the one. Elisabeth's performance is yet another horror display for The Academy to ignore when the year comes to a close. In comparison to Hereditary's Toni Colette or Us' Lupita Nyong' o, I admit that I would give an Oscar to one of these two over Moss. However, this is one of the main issues I have when people compare things from different years: it's extremely unfair and a bit irrational. Something \"great\" in a specific year can be just \"okay\" in the next one. It depends on each year's quality regarding movies and their cast's performances.\r\n\r\nIf Moss truly ends up delivering the best interpretation of the year, she should receive recognition independently of other year's injustices. With that said, based on my experience, I firmly believe Elisabeth Moss should be one of the contenders for the respective category during the awards season. I'm not saying she should be nominated or not, I'm saying that she should be one to think of when it's time to fill the ballot with the nominees. She is relentlessly exceptional during the whole runtime. There isn't a single moment where she drops her level. Impressive!\r\n\r\nRegarding the story, it's probably the best adaptation of The Invisible Man to the actual world that they could have done. Of all the meaningful and sensitive real-world themes, Leigh Whannell chose the very best to insert in his film. Domestic violence and abuse is a tremendously serious topic, and Whannell addresses it perfectly. It's a remarkably clever screenplay, with tons of tiny little details that relate in some shape or form to the real-life situations a lot of people (women AND men, let's not pretend this is an exclusively female problem) go through.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the best horror movies I've seen lately when it comes to creating a suspenseful, scary environment, mostly based on something that feels incredibly realistic. Taking the sci-fi aspect of, well, dealing with an invisible person, the menacing silence and haunting score work as well as they do because I'm able to feel the protagonist's fear. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is one of the main reasons why this film is filled with so much efficient suspense. The camera constantly pauses on one side of the room the character's in, lingering on for some seconds, creating a certain doubt if something's moving or if someone's there.\r\n\r\nThis point-of-view (POV) shot works exceptionally well for the whole movie. Being able to see what the main character is seeing, it's also possible to think what she's thinking and feel what she's feeling. That awkward, frustrating, unnerving, uneasy feeling that something's not right. Then, Whannell proves he knows his film's own weaknesses. When it starts to lose a bit of its entertainment value, and when the audience begins to get used to the long, suspenseful sequences (of which probably half, nothing happens), he hits the narrative with an unexpected, shocking turn of events in the most jaw-dropping way possible.\r\n\r\nThis particular decision got the blood heavily pumping again, and it delivered the energy I needed to be at the edge of my seat until the very end. However, the ending is a tad underwhelming, and maybe a bit over-the-top concerning some character's decisions. I can't really get into spoiler territory, so I'll just write I don't really think that the last scene is very coherent with everything the movie showed until that point. Even though I understand and respect this narrative decision, I don't believe its message is the one the film wanted to transmit. Good performances from the rest of the cast, a few character's decisions are a bit hard to believe, but I don't want to be nitpicky.\r\n\r\nIn the end, The Invisible Man deserves all the hype it's been getting. Leigh Whannell crafted a genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful horror movie, based on a traumatic real-life situation that a lot of people, unfortunately, go through. Elisabeth Moss delivers an emotionally powerful performance, demonstrating all of her impressive acting abilities which are probably going to be ignored when the awards season comes around (the usual horror genre bias). Incredibly well-written, intelligent screenplay, supported by some terrific camera work by Stefan Duscio. The haunting score from Benjamin Wallfisch is also a standout, especially when it chooses to be completely silent. I'm not a fan of the slightly incoherent ending since some character/narrative decisions seem hard to believe, and the final message didn't really have the meaning it should. Nevertheless, it's one of the best films of the year so far, so don't miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "**_Starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness_**\r\n\r\n>_I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got._\r\n\r\n- H.G. Wells; _The Invisible Man_ (1897)\r\n\r\nH.G. Wells's original _The Invisible Man_ (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Paul Verhoeven's _Hollow Man_ (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a modern tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, is a fascinating idea. Reorienting the narrative so it no longer focuses on the male scientist but on a female victim of his machinations creates the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next. It tries to have its cake and eat it \u2013 it wants to be an allegory for the problems women face leaving abusive relationships but it also wants to be an effective monster movie. And, ultimately, it ends up as neither.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman), who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Leigh Whannell (co-creator of the _Saw_ franchise and creator of the _Insidious_ franchise), this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making \u2013 men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm; years of abuse will carry on their work even if they're no longer around. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved. It is, of course, allegorical insofar as Cecilia isn't claiming that Adrian is just gaslighting her, she's claiming that he's literally turned himself invisible to drive her insane, but some of the best allegory works by exaggeration, and/or rendering something abstract as something more tangible.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film looks terrific. Designed by Alex Holmes (_Wish You Were Here_; _The Babadook_; _The Nightingale_), Adrian's house is a modernist maze of glass, mirrors, sliding panels, and open space, and the ultra-high-tech nerve centre from which he controls his kingdom is one of the film's only overt nods to science fiction (aside from the whole invisibility thing, of course). The real aesthetic strength, however, is the cinematography by Stefan Duscio (_Jungle_; _Upgrade_; _Judy & Punch_), into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.\r\n\r\nBefore talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this \u2013 one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels. Also, if you were so convinced that you were being stalked by someone invisible, might it not occur to you to invest in a pair of IR glasses for a few hundred bucks on Amazon? Just a thought.\r\n\r\nHowever, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, _Hollow Man_ has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but _Hollow Man_ never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas _The Invisible Man_ clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory _d\u00e9nouement_, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start; he's essentially a comic book villain, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, otherwise everyone would see through then. Oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.\r\n\r\nAlthough _The Invisible Man_ was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity.",
            "It seems that you can teach an old dog new tricks, at least when it comes to classic Universal monster movies. Writer / director Leigh Whannell\u2018s suspenseful reboot and reimagining of \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d is smart, well-acted, and full of thrills. It\u2019s a surprisingly fresh take on dated source material.\r\n\r\nCecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with her wealthy scientist husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). After drugging him one night, the terrified woman escapes and disappears, hiding at a policeman friend\u2019s (Aldis Hodge) house. Overcome with loneliness, Adrian commits suicide \u2014 but Cecilia suspects his death is a hoax. After a series of creepy coincidences that eventually turn lethal, Cecilia\u2019s sanity begins to unravel as she tries desperately to prove she\u2019s being haunted and hunted by an invisible force that happens to be her departed ex.\r\n\r\nBy telling the story from the woman\u2019s point of view, Whannell has given the film a contemporary feminist spin that makes it all the more haunting and effective. It\u2019s scary because the details of mental abuse by a partner feels so real, as the manipulation and controlling behavior feeds Cecilia\u2019s paranoia. It\u2019s one of the more chilling horror films (or rather, monster movies) that\u2019s come along in quite a while.\r\n\r\nMoss makes her performance look effortless as she wrestles with an empty corner of a room or throws punches into the air. Casting a talented actor in the lead role makes all the difference and prevents this from becoming just another hokey Blumhouse production.\r\n\r\nAlthough serious themes like domestic abuse and mental illness are tackled in an honest way, \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d is so entertaining because it achieves the right mix of terror and female empowerment.",
            "If you want to watch this, don't. If you want to watch an 'invisible man' movie, watch the original 'The Hollow Man'. I actually had to rewatch 'The Hollow Man' just to wash my eyes after this. The manlet of a woman in this movie that they call an actress is 100 times worse than Rhona Mitha's performance in 'The Hollow Man'.",
            "> **_Review on Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nDirector Leigh Whannell had a crisp and clear vision when adapting this classic Universal monster The Invisible Man, into a modern re-telling that taps into the relevantly dark dangers of a domestic relationship, exploring such a theme with the upmost intensity and craft. This is a classic horror tale adapted with a contemporary twist, focusing more on the psychological mayhem we're forced to endure, much like our protagonist Cecilia, who's tormented in chilling manners. Already within 2020 this is the sleeper-hit of the year, one that on paper looks a lot more naff than what we are actually presented with.\r\n\r\nMoss is the core of the movie here, playing as the heartbeat of the entire duration. Through Whannell and Moss' talent combined we are forced to endure emotional and brutal intensity, throwing its audiences and main protagonist through nerve-wrecking intensity, tapping into the fear of the unseen that worked so well with the likes of It Follows. \r\n\r\nMoss' performance as Cecilia is superb, as her portrayal of unhinged woman broken from domestic abuse is both unsettling and devastating, already leading to one of strongest female lead performances of the year so far. Whilst the portrayal of constant angst is unforgettable, it's her balanced likability that keeps Cecilia so fascinating, without the character ever compromising her morals or intelligence. A character like this is refreshing to see, especially when they ultimately get their moment to redeems themselves, which she absolutely does.\r\n\r\nImage result for the invisible man 2020\r\nThe most successful element of The Invisible Man is undoubtately the chilling, ice-cold intensity, delivering an unshakable tautness that will have your cage rattles until the closing credits. Whannell's lever use of cinematography with large concrete open spaces and a washed-out colour palette enhances the presence of the Invisible Man himself, allowing paranoia and angst to trickle through bit by bit until it reaches an un-palpable level of tension. Even though we can't see him, his presence is truly unsettling, and once we do, like a bucket of paint to the face, we are then treated to more than a few effective jump scares. Less is more, and The Invisible Man surely capitalises on this, rinsing its novelty for everything its got, for maximum fear factor.\r\n\r\nBehind this creepy facade is an intelligent thriller, that after the half-way mark begins to toy with the narratives origins, often hoodwinking the audience until credits role. There is flare to Whannell's direction here, as some of the themes being juggled around here could very easily have resulted in a cheesy and half-baked result, which to my surprise wasn't the case. In fact, the entire film and premise could have so easily been a disaster, and on paper shouldn't really hold up. To my surprise and probably yours, it's way more effective and haunting than I ever would have given it credit for.\r\n\r\nWith a runtime of nearly two hours, it's surprising how The Invisible Man never feels like it's dragging, nor does it ever let up on the tension. In fact, the movie progressively get more and more unhinged and intense as the movie goes on, and only until the very end do we ever get a second to settle or breathe.\r\n\r\nThis is what great horror movie experiences are about, and like every great horror experience it is easy to forgive and forget its mishaps. Moss' depiction of Cecilia is fantastic, there is no denying that, however it's perhaps the character itself who could have benefited slightly from more depth. More details on exactly what she would have endured or more clarity in her mental decay could have packed a stronger emotional punch overall. In saying this, when we witness her ultimate and long overdue redemption, it is superbly satisfying. Ask the girls who cheered in the audience, they'll agree with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT\r\nWelcome to the horror sleeper-hit of 2020. The Invisible Man delivers unpalatable tension like no other, also boasting a stellar cast with slick delivery. Universal Monsters have never looked so good.",
            "This is a film that tries to be smart and clearly isn't. It has more holes than a colander containing Swiss cheese being held by Christ. This film thinks it's so edgy when it couldn't be further from it. It's a low budget, badly acted, dire attempt to contemporise a classic story. Do yourself a favour and don't bother.",
            "Well made horror-thriller that takes the classic version updated for today with not only the effects but violence, which was very effective. A little predictable in some respects but ultimately entertaining and features a good performance by Elisabeth Moss. Going the more lower budget with Universal's \"monster\" remakes the best route, hopefully they learned their lesson from blunders of The Mummy. **3.75/5**",

            "Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis really is a \"what if\" they extended the scenes from \"Hollow Man\" where Kevin Bacon gets into the public and starts messing with people.\r\n\r\nI am starting to worry about Elisabeth Moss though, she seems to be type-casting into all these heavy handed dramatic roles, or maybe that's just how she acts. She's certainly good enough to pull it off, so it's not a downside of the movie, it's just part of a note that this movie is very much a slow-burn suspense.  On the premise alone, the first 2 acts are going to be that way as it is established that she is / isn't crazy and there is an invisible man stalking and sabotaging her.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the movie is that there has never been a more plausible and clearly reasoned explanation for the events, to include camera footage and dead bodies, than she has in this story.  If someone finalized a version of a wearable inviso-suit, then this is exactly the type of nonsense they're going to get up to, especially if no one knows about it.\r\n\r\nIt is a little irritating how they handle him once he's been exposed as well.  Mostly it's because of the premise that no one believes her, but you'd think people had seen a ghost movie, or would have a clever idea.\r\n\r\nIf the movie sounds good to you at all, then I really think you'll enjoy it.",
            "An excellent adaption of the Universal classic. Wholly original, modernized, and thrilling, building off writer/director Leigh Whannell's fantastic science fiction debut Upgrade.",
            "**The Invisible Man tells a story we have seen too many times in a fresh, terrifying, and ASTOUNDING way!**\r\n\r\nBlumhouse's reimagining of The Invisible Man is PURE BRILLIANCE as it tells of a woman surviving a dangerously abusive relationship only to question if she had truly escaped. Paranoia and anxiety saturate every moment of The Invisible Man. Elizabeth Moss's performance of terrified but strong Cecelia makes the Invisible Man believable and all the more chilling. Director Leigh Whannell comes fresh off of the extraordinary Upgrade (2018) to deliver another unique and innovative horror must-see. Blumhouse is the clear powerhouse of horror films, and The Invisible Man is one of their best.",
            "The Invisible Man, directed by Leigh Whannell, delivers a solid story with many twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. While the pacing is slow and the final reveal lacks a bit of punch, the film has a decent amount of suspense that keeps the tension high.\r\n\r\nThe acting in the film is fantastic all around, with Elisabeth Moss delivering a brilliant performance as the lead character, conveying fear and helplessness in a way that is both honest and heartbreaking. Aldis Hodge also delivers a standout performance, bringing a calm but intensely serious attitude to his role that creates a sense of trust not only with Moss\u2019s character but with the audience as well. Storm Reid also surprises with a performance that adds a sense of lightheartedness to an otherwise dark and depressing screenplay.\r\n\r\nLeigh Whannell's direction is stellar, with some really creative imagery that explores the unique concept of invisibility. The scene in the mental hospital stands out as a highlight, with brutal action and sharp camera angles that keep the audience engaged.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while The Invisible Man may have its flaws, it is a solid thriller that benefits from excellent performances and fantastic direction. Fans of suspenseful movies will find plenty to enjoy here, even if it's not the scariest film out there.\r\n\r\nScore: 71%\r\nVerdict: Good"

            "> A fight among the gods, for the Egyptian empire.\r\n\r\nI like this director, but this is not his best work. I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAt least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.\r\n\r\nI had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.\r\n\r\nWell composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.\r\n\r\n6/10",
            "The illegitimate child of _Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen_ and _Marvel's Thor_. One that probably should have been aborted.\r\n\r\nI could see _Gods of Egypt_ working in the \"dumb fun\" kind of way, if it hadn't been so bloated and overly long. As it stands, it has some very neat design choices... And that's it. That's all it has going for it. Not a single actor seems to care that they're in this movie, the digital effects are hit and miss at best, and the story is sillier than it had to be, yet not as entertaining as it could have been.\r\n\r\nBut yes. Some great designs.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._",
            "Fantasy is very difficult to get right in films.  Audience resistance is quite high, especially when it involves characters with difficult-to-remember names or diverse place names.   Relating to a fantasy world of beasts and magic is often tricky for audiences who may prefer grounded, realistic drama.  There are exceptions though \u2013 the worlds of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings captured public imaginations and the complex mass of stories and themes in Game of Thrones also attracted an audience.\r\nThis fear of fantasy seems to have informed a slightly tentative approach in the writing and direction of Gods of Egypt.  There are plenty of fantastic creatures present ranging from giant, vicious snake like creatures to Minotaurs in all but name, and an array of Egyptian gods.  However, there has been avoidance of any of the cod Shakespearean dialogue that often permeates works of this type and an emphasis more upon realistic dialogue.  This creates a needless tension between the intensity of the innovative visuals and the prosaic words dropping from the actors, a tension that is never resolved as the linear story progresses forwards but never upwards.\r\nThe pleasures with this film arise mostly from the intensity of the visual experience.  Every environment has been precisely designed, full of colour and dimension, looking very different from the landscapes seen in past films based on myth and history.  The benefit of this is that there is always something to attract the eye, from great sky barges to rainbow lit waterfalls and massive monuments.  Like all Alex Proyas\u2019 films the visual ideas add weight and substance that the scripting sometimes fails to.\r\nIt is however that narrative which brings the film down with a series of very deliberate events extrapolated in excessive detail, burdened by actors who at times look deathly uncomfortable in their roles.  Only Geoffrey Rush, in a small but notable part, really excels with so many of the others not able to bring life to the dialogue as they intone in front of ever present green screens.\r\nIn the end it is a pity that such a wonderfully conceived world at the visual level could not have been combined with a compelling story and acting.",
            "When the credits rolled after having watched this movie with my kids I was perplexed. I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie\u2026a lot!\r\n\r\nSure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive \u201cheroes\u201d and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.\r\n\r\nI actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not \u201cethnically correct\u201d. What the f\u2026? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise\u2026\r\n\r\nYes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.\r\n\r\nThe rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called \u201ccritics\u201d. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.\r\n\r\nI would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection.",
            "I usually go for movies like this but.... whatever happened to practical effects? You lose me with too much blatant CGI. This movie, it seemed like it was only CGI.\r\n\r\nAnd not just CGI, but the kind of CGI that looks like a video game.\r\n\r\nIt honestly lost me right away, I gave it about ten minutes and just stopped."

            "While 'The Invisible Man' isn't perfect, it is (like 'Upgrade') a thoughtful take on the genre, cleverly using on- and off-screen space and delivering each big scare like an effectively-timed punchline.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-invisible-man-paranoia-gaslighting-and-spookiness",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAs you should know by now, I avoid trailers at all costs, especially for highly anticipated movies. I'm careful enough already, but once I heard the massive complaints about the trailer for The Invisible Man, I made sure to not even listen to it, let alone see something from it. My expectations got higher as the release date approached, and the overwhelmingly positive reactions reached my attention, so obviously, I couldn't help but get excited. I love The Handmaid's Tale, and I always thought it was a matter of time until Elisabeth Moss brought her phenomenal acting skills to the big screen. She just needed a big film to do it...\r\n\r\nAnd this is the one. Elisabeth's performance is yet another horror display for The Academy to ignore when the year comes to a close. In comparison to Hereditary's Toni Colette or Us' Lupita Nyong' o, I admit that I would give an Oscar to one of these two over Moss. However, this is one of the main issues I have when people compare things from different years: it's extremely unfair and a bit irrational. Something \"great\" in a specific year can be just \"okay\" in the next one. It depends on each year's quality regarding movies and their cast's performances.\r\n\r\nIf Moss truly ends up delivering the best interpretation of the year, she should receive recognition independently of other year's injustices. With that said, based on my experience, I firmly believe Elisabeth Moss should be one of the contenders for the respective category during the awards season. I'm not saying she should be nominated or not, I'm saying that she should be one to think of when it's time to fill the ballot with the nominees. She is relentlessly exceptional during the whole runtime. There isn't a single moment where she drops her level. Impressive!\r\n\r\nRegarding the story, it's probably the best adaptation of The Invisible Man to the actual world that they could have done. Of all the meaningful and sensitive real-world themes, Leigh Whannell chose the very best to insert in his film. Domestic violence and abuse is a tremendously serious topic, and Whannell addresses it perfectly. It's a remarkably clever screenplay, with tons of tiny little details that relate in some shape or form to the real-life situations a lot of people (women AND men, let's not pretend this is an exclusively female problem) go through.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the best horror movies I've seen lately when it comes to creating a suspenseful, scary environment, mostly based on something that feels incredibly realistic. Taking the sci-fi aspect of, well, dealing with an invisible person, the menacing silence and haunting score work as well as they do because I'm able to feel the protagonist's fear. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is one of the main reasons why this film is filled with so much efficient suspense. The camera constantly pauses on one side of the room the character's in, lingering on for some seconds, creating a certain doubt if something's moving or if someone's there.\r\n\r\nThis point-of-view (POV) shot works exceptionally well for the whole movie. Being able to see what the main character is seeing, it's also possible to think what she's thinking and feel what she's feeling. That awkward, frustrating, unnerving, uneasy feeling that something's not right. Then, Whannell proves he knows his film's own weaknesses. When it starts to lose a bit of its entertainment value, and when the audience begins to get used to the long, suspenseful sequences (of which probably half, nothing happens), he hits the narrative with an unexpected, shocking turn of events in the most jaw-dropping way possible.\r\n\r\nThis particular decision got the blood heavily pumping again, and it delivered the energy I needed to be at the edge of my seat until the very end. However, the ending is a tad underwhelming, and maybe a bit over-the-top concerning some character's decisions. I can't really get into spoiler territory, so I'll just write I don't really think that the last scene is very coherent with everything the movie showed until that point. Even though I understand and respect this narrative decision, I don't believe its message is the one the film wanted to transmit. Good performances from the rest of the cast, a few character's decisions are a bit hard to believe, but I don't want to be nitpicky.\r\n\r\nIn the end, The Invisible Man deserves all the hype it's been getting. Leigh Whannell crafted a genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful horror movie, based on a traumatic real-life situation that a lot of people, unfortunately, go through. Elisabeth Moss delivers an emotionally powerful performance, demonstrating all of her impressive acting abilities which are probably going to be ignored when the awards season comes around (the usual horror genre bias). Incredibly well-written, intelligent screenplay, supported by some terrific camera work by Stefan Duscio. The haunting score from Benjamin Wallfisch is also a standout, especially when it chooses to be completely silent. I'm not a fan of the slightly incoherent ending since some character/narrative decisions seem hard to believe, and the final message didn't really have the meaning it should. Nevertheless, it's one of the best films of the year so far, so don't miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "**_Starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness_**\r\n\r\n>_I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got._\r\n\r\n- H.G. Wells; _The Invisible Man_ (1897)\r\n\r\nH.G. Wells's original _The Invisible Man_ (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Paul Verhoeven's _Hollow Man_ (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a modern tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, is a fascinating idea. Reorienting the narrative so it no longer focuses on the male scientist but on a female victim of his machinations creates the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next. It tries to have its cake and eat it \u2013 it wants to be an allegory for the problems women face leaving abusive relationships but it also wants to be an effective monster movie. And, ultimately, it ends up as neither.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman), who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Leigh Whannell (co-creator of the _Saw_ franchise and creator of the _Insidious_ franchise), this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making \u2013 men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm; years of abuse will carry on their work even if they're no longer around. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved. It is, of course, allegorical insofar as Cecilia isn't claiming that Adrian is just gaslighting her, she's claiming that he's literally turned himself invisible to drive her insane, but some of the best allegory works by exaggeration, and/or rendering something abstract as something more tangible.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, the film looks terrific. Designed by Alex Holmes (_Wish You Were Here_; _The Babadook_; _The Nightingale_), Adrian's house is a modernist maze of glass, mirrors, sliding panels, and open space, and the ultra-high-tech nerve centre from which he controls his kingdom is one of the film's only overt nods to science fiction (aside from the whole invisibility thing, of course). The real aesthetic strength, however, is the cinematography by Stefan Duscio (_Jungle_; _Upgrade_; _Judy & Punch_), into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.\r\n\r\nBefore talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this \u2013 one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels. Also, if you were so convinced that you were being stalked by someone invisible, might it not occur to you to invest in a pair of IR glasses for a few hundred bucks on Amazon? Just a thought.\r\n\r\nHowever, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, _Hollow Man_ has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but _Hollow Man_ never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas _The Invisible Man_ clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory _d\u00e9nouement_, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start; he's essentially a comic book villain, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, otherwise everyone would see through then. Oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.\r\n\r\nAlthough _The Invisible Man_ was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity.",
            "It seems that you can teach an old dog new tricks, at least when it comes to classic Universal monster movies. Writer / director Leigh Whannell\u2018s suspenseful reboot and reimagining of \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d is smart, well-acted, and full of thrills. It\u2019s a surprisingly fresh take on dated source material.\r\n\r\nCecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with her wealthy scientist husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). After drugging him one night, the terrified woman escapes and disappears, hiding at a policeman friend\u2019s (Aldis Hodge) house. Overcome with loneliness, Adrian commits suicide \u2014 but Cecilia suspects his death is a hoax. After a series of creepy coincidences that eventually turn lethal, Cecilia\u2019s sanity begins to unravel as she tries desperately to prove she\u2019s being haunted and hunted by an invisible force that happens to be her departed ex.\r\n\r\nBy telling the story from the woman\u2019s point of view, Whannell has given the film a contemporary feminist spin that makes it all the more haunting and effective. It\u2019s scary because the details of mental abuse by a partner feels so real, as the manipulation and controlling behavior feeds Cecilia\u2019s paranoia. It\u2019s one of the more chilling horror films (or rather, monster movies) that\u2019s come along in quite a while.\r\n\r\nMoss makes her performance look effortless as she wrestles with an empty corner of a room or throws punches into the air. Casting a talented actor in the lead role makes all the difference and prevents this from becoming just another hokey Blumhouse production.\r\n\r\nAlthough serious themes like domestic abuse and mental illness are tackled in an honest way, \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d is so entertaining because it achieves the right mix of terror and female empowerment.",
            "If you want to watch this, don't. If you want to watch an 'invisible man' movie, watch the original 'The Hollow Man'. I actually had to rewatch 'The Hollow Man' just to wash my eyes after this. The manlet of a woman in this movie that they call an actress is 100 times worse than Rhona Mitha's performance in 'The Hollow Man'.",
            "> **_Review on Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nDirector Leigh Whannell had a crisp and clear vision when adapting this classic Universal monster The Invisible Man, into a modern re-telling that taps into the relevantly dark dangers of a domestic relationship, exploring such a theme with the upmost intensity and craft. This is a classic horror tale adapted with a contemporary twist, focusing more on the psychological mayhem we're forced to endure, much like our protagonist Cecilia, who's tormented in chilling manners. Already within 2020 this is the sleeper-hit of the year, one that on paper looks a lot more naff than what we are actually presented with.\r\n\r\nMoss is the core of the movie here, playing as the heartbeat of the entire duration. Through Whannell and Moss' talent combined we are forced to endure emotional and brutal intensity, throwing its audiences and main protagonist through nerve-wrecking intensity, tapping into the fear of the unseen that worked so well with the likes of It Follows. \r\n\r\nMoss' performance as Cecilia is superb, as her portrayal of unhinged woman broken from domestic abuse is both unsettling and devastating, already leading to one of strongest female lead performances of the year so far. Whilst the portrayal of constant angst is unforgettable, it's her balanced likability that keeps Cecilia so fascinating, without the character ever compromising her morals or intelligence. A character like this is refreshing to see, especially when they ultimately get their moment to redeems themselves, which she absolutely does.\r\n\r\nImage result for the invisible man 2020\r\nThe most successful element of The Invisible Man is undoubtately the chilling, ice-cold intensity, delivering an unshakable tautness that will have your cage rattles until the closing credits. Whannell's lever use of cinematography with large concrete open spaces and a washed-out colour palette enhances the presence of the Invisible Man himself, allowing paranoia and angst to trickle through bit by bit until it reaches an un-palpable level of tension. Even though we can't see him, his presence is truly unsettling, and once we do, like a bucket of paint to the face, we are then treated to more than a few effective jump scares. Less is more, and The Invisible Man surely capitalises on this, rinsing its novelty for everything its got, for maximum fear factor.\r\n\r\nBehind this creepy facade is an intelligent thriller, that after the half-way mark begins to toy with the narratives origins, often hoodwinking the audience until credits role. There is flare to Whannell's direction here, as some of the themes being juggled around here could very easily have resulted in a cheesy and half-baked result, which to my surprise wasn't the case. In fact, the entire film and premise could have so easily been a disaster, and on paper shouldn't really hold up. To my surprise and probably yours, it's way more effective and haunting than I ever would have given it credit for.\r\n\r\nWith a runtime of nearly two hours, it's surprising how The Invisible Man never feels like it's dragging, nor does it ever let up on the tension. In fact, the movie progressively get more and more unhinged and intense as the movie goes on, and only until the very end do we ever get a second to settle or breathe.\r\n\r\nThis is what great horror movie experiences are about, and like every great horror experience it is easy to forgive and forget its mishaps. Moss' depiction of Cecilia is fantastic, there is no denying that, however it's perhaps the character itself who could have benefited slightly from more depth. More details on exactly what she would have endured or more clarity in her mental decay could have packed a stronger emotional punch overall. In saying this, when we witness her ultimate and long overdue redemption, it is superbly satisfying. Ask the girls who cheered in the audience, they'll agree with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT\r\nWelcome to the horror sleeper-hit of 2020. The Invisible Man delivers unpalatable tension like no other, also boasting a stellar cast with slick delivery. Universal Monsters have never looked so good.",
            "This is a film that tries to be smart and clearly isn't. It has more holes than a colander containing Swiss cheese being held by Christ. This film thinks it's so edgy when it couldn't be further from it. It's a low budget, badly acted, dire attempt to contemporise a classic story. Do yourself a favour and don't bother.",
            "Well made horror-thriller that takes the classic version updated for today with not only the effects but violence, which was very effective. A little predictable in some respects but ultimately entertaining and features a good performance by Elisabeth Moss. Going the more lower budget with Universal's \"monster\" remakes the best route, hopefully they learned their lesson from blunders of The Mummy. **3.75/5**",

            "Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis really is a \"what if\" they extended the scenes from \"Hollow Man\" where Kevin Bacon gets into the public and starts messing with people.\r\n\r\nI am starting to worry about Elisabeth Moss though, she seems to be type-casting into all these heavy handed dramatic roles, or maybe that's just how she acts. She's certainly good enough to pull it off, so it's not a downside of the movie, it's just part of a note that this movie is very much a slow-burn suspense.  On the premise alone, the first 2 acts are going to be that way as it is established that she is / isn't crazy and there is an invisible man stalking and sabotaging her.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the movie is that there has never been a more plausible and clearly reasoned explanation for the events, to include camera footage and dead bodies, than she has in this story.  If someone finalized a version of a wearable inviso-suit, then this is exactly the type of nonsense they're going to get up to, especially if no one knows about it.\r\n\r\nIt is a little irritating how they handle him once he's been exposed as well.  Mostly it's because of the premise that no one believes her, but you'd think people had seen a ghost movie, or would have a clever idea.\r\n\r\nIf the movie sounds good to you at all, then I really think you'll enjoy it.",
            "An excellent adaption of the Universal classic. Wholly original, modernized, and thrilling, building off writer/director Leigh Whannell's fantastic science fiction debut Upgrade.",
            "**The Invisible Man tells a story we have seen too many times in a fresh, terrifying, and ASTOUNDING way!**\r\n\r\nBlumhouse's reimagining of The Invisible Man is PURE BRILLIANCE as it tells of a woman surviving a dangerously abusive relationship only to question if she had truly escaped. Paranoia and anxiety saturate every moment of The Invisible Man. Elizabeth Moss's performance of terrified but strong Cecelia makes the Invisible Man believable and all the more chilling. Director Leigh Whannell comes fresh off of the extraordinary Upgrade (2018) to deliver another unique and innovative horror must-see. Blumhouse is the clear powerhouse of horror films, and The Invisible Man is one of their best.",
            "The Invisible Man, directed by Leigh Whannell, delivers a solid story with many twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. While the pacing is slow and the final reveal lacks a bit of punch, the film has a decent amount of suspense that keeps the tension high.\r\n\r\nThe acting in the film is fantastic all around, with Elisabeth Moss delivering a brilliant performance as the lead character, conveying fear and helplessness in a way that is both honest and heartbreaking. Aldis Hodge also delivers a standout performance, bringing a calm but intensely serious attitude to his role that creates a sense of trust not only with Moss\u2019s character but with the audience as well. Storm Reid also surprises with a performance that adds a sense of lightheartedness to an otherwise dark and depressing screenplay.\r\n\r\nLeigh Whannell's direction is stellar, with some really creative imagery that explores the unique concept of invisibility. The scene in the mental hospital stands out as a highlight, with brutal action and sharp camera angles that keep the audience engaged.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while The Invisible Man may have its flaws, it is a solid thriller that benefits from excellent performances and fantastic direction. Fans of suspenseful movies will find plenty to enjoy here, even if it's not the scariest film out there.\r\n\r\nScore: 71%\r\nVerdict: Good"

            "Low budget classic that is now a genre landmark.\r\n\r\nSet somewhere in the future we are privy to a world where the roads are ruled by maniac gangs with souped up cars, and bikers that literally could come from hell. Trying to stop these marauding loons are the overstretched police force who themselves ride in exceptionally fast cars. At the front of this story is Max Rockatansky, a good honest cop trying to hold his own against the chaotic world that is forming around him. After his best friend is burned and left for dead he decides enough is enough and thinks about retiring from the service, but whilst on a vacation with his wife and child things go decidedly bad and Max becomes an avenging force of fury with devastating affect.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating this film I feel it really needs to be put into perspective just how brilliant a job director George Miller did with next to no cash to work with, in fact Miller edited the film in his own bedroom just to emphasise the low-fi nature of the beast. The costumes are excellent, the cast are terrific, with Mel Gibson as Max particularly impressive, and here we have villains to truly fit the word villainous, but it's the stunts and chase sequences that makes this film a rich rewarding experience. The opening ten minutes alone are pure adrenalin pumping genius, but the film as a whole delivers a crash bang wallop punch that has often been imitated since its release, but rarely bettered, and although the heart of the film is a simple revenge story, it grabs your attention and delivers right to the corking finale, 8/10.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Region 2 Users should note that the bargain bucket Mad Max Trilogy flip pack set still contains the foolishly dubbed version of this film, incredibly stupid move from the American distributors.",
            "Though I had only seen the previous installment, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome', which I enjoyed whilst a great many people didn't, with the present sequel earning ten (!?) Oscar nominations, I wanted to catch up on things before seeing the new film at the Cineplex. I was very pleased with this early film in the post-apocalyptic movie category, and can see how and why both it and star Mel Gibson became so successful. Other than Kenneth Anger's experimental film, 'Scorpio Rising', I have never seen a work that so fetishes both cars and the ritual of dressing, either for driving or for war. It's very well directed and suspenseful for a first-timer in Miller, and I'm so glad he's still helming the films of the series 36 years later! All that one has to do to see How To and How Not To Continue a Fine Franchise is compare how both George Miller and George Lucas have done this century. It's sad that they were so short on funds that only Gibson could be fitted with real leather in the film--I think I can rightly assume that money isn't a problem anymore...",

            "It's not often that these dystopian scenarios ever leave the USA, so it's interesting that this one introduces us to the massive expanse of the Australian desert and to the young policeman \"Max\" (Mel Gibson). His job is pretty thankless - and perilous. He must patrol the remote countryside trying to protect what is left of civilisation from marauding motor cycle gangs who are constantly on the search for fuel - for themselves and for their machines. Things start to boil over when ruthless biker \"Toe-cutter\" (Hugh Keays-Byrne) avenges the death of his leader by killing just about everyone he can find - including the wife and child of the now incandescent \"Max\". What now ensues is a grittily told, quickly paced, tale of violence and vengeance with the erstwhile law officer abandoning any sense of decency he had clung onto and going all out to destroy his enemy. This film ought to be remembered for what it spawned, rather than what it offers by itself. Most of the acting is mediocre, as is the dialogue and after a while the brutality started, for me anyway, to lose potency and become almost comedic. This is certainly ninety minutes of cinema history, but it's really not very good.",
            "The action is stupendous, but the rest is a bit of a drag.\r\n\r\nWhen the attackers be attacking it's all great to watch, like I got a lot of entertainment from seeing Toecutter's gang do their thing; and vice-versa with the MFP, really. However, the film kinda goes through peaks and troughs in switching from the action to the more mundane and the latter parts did bore me a little.\r\n\r\nThe characters of Max and Jessie do act noticeably dumb in bits too, I don't necessarily mind that as the whole movie is silly and all those onscreen chew the heck out of the scenery. But it does get a bit annoying to watch, I can't lie. I do like how much extra the characters act in general, though.\r\n\r\nThe whole 90 minutes of <em>'Mad Max'</em> are over the top completely, but it does fit for the majority. I just wanted wall-to-wall overexuberant action, rather than that sprinkled amongst some fairly dull attempted storytelling. Still, I am looking forward to viewing the sequels/spin-offs, particularly those modern-day releases."

            "Wetter than a fishes bathing costume.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pretty unadventurous title that matches the content of the film. Directed by Steve Beck and starring Gabriel Byrne, Desmond Harrington, Ron Eldard and Julianna Margulies, plot finds a salvage crew discovering a long lost passenger liner out in the remote Bering Sea. With the laws of the sea stating that they can keep what they find, they are delighted to find gold on board. But it\u2019s not long before strange things start to happen.\r\n\r\nIt starts of real well with a bloody and gruesome prelude, the production design is super and everything is in place for a chiller out there in the foggy waters. Unfortunately what we actually get is a predictable series of clich\u00e9s cribbed from better movies of the past, none of which capable of eliciting a genuine scare. The makers think that having a bombastic techno score accompanying the dramatic moments will make them appear more shocking. It doesn\u2019t, while the cast are ill served by direction and writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorror 101 for beginners. 3/10",
            "I remember thinking this was good as a child... I was wrong.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._",
            "Ghostly happenings on a decades-lost lost ocean liner \r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Steve Beck, \"Ghost Ship\" revolves around salvagers finding a mysterious ship in the Bering Sea that's been lost for four decades and they intend to claim it, but things go from strange to worse as they board the eerie vessel and try to tow it to harbor.\r\n\r\nThe cast is strong, headed by Gabriel Byrne. Emily Brown appears as a 12 year-old girl. Julianna Margulies looks fine but they don't do enough with her. Francesca Rettondini is also on hand. Let's just say the low-budget \"Ghost Voyage\" (2008) is better in the area of women.\r\n\r\nStill, the ship sets are excellent and it certainly seems like they shot the film on a real vessel. Interestingly, the Antonia Graza of the movie is a replica of the Andrea Doria.  Other positives include: The refreshing score with \u201cNot Falling\u201d by Mudvayne thrown in for good measure; a nice haunting atmosphere at sea with one creepy scene reminiscent of the excellent \u201cDead Calm\u201d (1989); potent visuals of the formidable vessel looming over the tugboat; plus some good thrills, notably one of the greatest horror scenes in the history of cinema in the prologue, no kidding. There's also a decent revelation thrown in at the end.\r\n\r\nIf you like this one be sure to check out the aforementioned \"Ghost Voyage,\" which is a TV movie. \"Ghost Ship\" was released to theaters and obviously had a bigger budget, but that doesn't mean it's better, just that it's more polished.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 91 minutes. WRITERS: Mark Hanlon and John Pogue.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

There are some fun cheesy moments here and there but kind of like Thirteen Ghosts (same director), has some interesting ideas that don't amount to much. Course, I'm also not much of a fan of supernatural horror movies as they play fast and loose with the rules. **2.5/5**",

            "The beginning and the end of this movie is really the only good thing about the movie. Everything else is just a crew chasing around a ghost girl trying to figure out what happened to her. Pretty boring."

Approach in incredibly tense interactions through the lingering camera, minimal editing (Peter Sciberras), and contemplative music (Jonny Greenwood). The aimless first half might only be a first-watch issue, but nothing that profoundly hurts the overall piece.\r\n\r\nAn awards contender that I definitely recommend watching, even more than once.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "Jane Campion's direction is top-notch, beautifully shot by Ari Wegner, and Johnny Greenwood's score fits like a soft leather glove. But that script - oh so Hollywood and oh so boring!! I want my 127 minutes back.",
            "**Full Explanation and Analysis at Spotamovie.com - The Story** - The Power of the Dog, a book written by Thomas Savage in 1967, inspires the film. It\u2019s not your typical western. No guns are involved, but something more complex and psychological. Located in Montana in 1925, two wealthy and different brothers, George and Phil, own a ranch.Their lives change when they meet Rose, a widow, mum to Peter, a delicate but intelligent guy. Different personalities and interests generate a hostile environment for all of our characters. After the chaos, the dreamed balance may rise again, but, first, the story will become intense, engaging and exhausting.What will happen between them? Why George and Phil are different? And what is The Power of the Dog? It\u2019s a complex film, full of symbolism, metaphors and psychology. It\u2019s well-directed, excellently performed by the whole cast. And it\u2019s not a case that, as we mentioned above, Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst are in nominations as best actors at the Golden Globe 2022. - **Analysis **here https://www.spotamovie.com/the-power-of-the-dog-explanation-and-review-2021-movie/",
            "The ending does not match the pacing of the the entire film at all. It's almost abrupt - and not in a terribly satisfying way. It could have been 30 minutes shorter if it did less artful shots of wheat or a horse standing. Or at least for less time. It doesn't even really say anything interesting about it either.",
            "Brothers \"Phil\" (Benedict Cumberbatch) and \"George\" (Jesse Plemons) are the bit chalk-and-cheese brothers who own a successful cattle ranch. On a trip to town, \"Phil\" upsets the owner of the hotel \"Rose\" (an effective Kirstin Dunst) after he rather cruelly insults her extremely svelte teenage son \"Peter\" (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who had taken some care to prepare intricate paper decorations for their dining table. We don't know how long \"George\" and \"Rose\" have been friends, but next thing we know they are married and the pretty unpleasant \"Phil\" sets out to make her life as miserable as possible. He is never overtly cruel - there is no violence, but mental abuse that sends her seeking solace in the bottle. When her son joins them from school, he fixes him fairly and squarely in his sights too - introducing a hint of homo-eroticism and scheming to the last fifteen minutes that makes you sit up. Again, no action as such - there are no gunfights or fisticuffs, just a cleverly structured denouement that I felt fitting. The pace is really slow, the dialogue pretty laconic, Cumberbatch's accent is all over the place and the score becomes wearisome after a while - the sounds of the constant high pitched violins really did begin to grate. It is a lovely film to look at, plenty of attention to the detail, but it is altogether just a bit so what.",

They\u2019re wealthy ranchers who are polar opposites. Where Phil is brutal and ruthless, George is kind and quiet. Their relationship splinters when George marries Rose, a widow (Kirsten Dunst). Campion makes you believe that this is where the meat of the movie will be, in this fractured brotherly relationship, and for a while it is. It\u2019s a fascinating look at two versions of masculinity at odds with each other in a world that could be considered the peak of masculinity. I couldn\u2019t help but think of Kelly Reichardt\u2019s First Cow and Andrew Haigh\u2019s Lean on Pete, two lovely movies grappling with the same concept of masculinity in the harshness of the American West."

            "\"In an alternate mid-80\u2019s universe, director Joe Dante\u2019s follow-up to his grim Yuletide fairy tale Gremlins would have been Safe Neighborhood, a crisp, crackling, black and bloody Christmas comedy/horror...\"\r\n\r\nRead the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2016/11/30/safe-neighborhood.html",
            "The holidays are approaching as we prepare to reach the end of the year but director/co-writer Chris Peckover wants to beat the chaotic Christmas rush by offering some creepy coal in his cinematic stockings\u2013most notably a merry-minded macabre middle finger to the Yuletide season in the charmingly twisted and creatively corrosive suburban home invasion horror thriller **Better Watch Out**. \r\n\r\nPeckover, whose darkened delve into the timely and topical political bonfire known as illegal immigration in 2010\u2019s disturbing and noteworthy _Undocumented_, delivers a diabolical ditty that resonates gleefully in subversive wit, sick-minded jingle hell fraught and turns upside down the tired conventional creepfest genre into an edgy, hair-raising horrific hoot armed with the favorably kind of rancid camp and rollicking recklessness that makes for an insatiable sick-minded satire. Indeed, one needs to raise their mug of tasty eggnog to celebrate the seasonal Christmas fear in the demented yet oddly inspired and viciously wired **Better Watch Out**. \r\n\r\nSure, **Better Watch Out** generously borrows from a number of films in the kiddie-imperiled, home invasion showcases that we have seen over time and time again. However, Peckover\u2019s sense of go-for-broke adventurous direction, a flippantly smart and energetic script, convincing off-the-wall but solid and disciplined performances and the nail-biting, naughty-minded nuttiness that runs amok in this 85-minute perverse, hedonistic home-bound torture chamber is genuinely realized. Although Watch appears to seemingly have an American pedigree in its cockeyed presentation of sweater-wearing Yanks nestled before an open fire on a scenic winter evening it is worth noting that **Better Watch Out** is a co-Australian production (most of the film was shot on location in Sydney) so some Aussie presence is definitely permeates in this eerie but insidiously cheeky domestic dire drama.\r\n\r\nCleverly, **Better Watch Out** (incidentally also known as _Safe Neighborhood_) somehow seems to elevate the impishly comical yet caustically slash-and-dash sub-genre to a whole new fresh level of appreciation whether offering a cynical spin on the cliched babysitter-in-charge yarn or poking biting fun at the hidden dysfunction of the privileged living in the pricey bubble of manicured lawns and gaudy, expansive homes in milquetoast Middle America. Interestingly, Peckover shares his generosity of sacrilege in using the spiritual aura of the Christmas landscape to skew the undercurrent idealism of cozy co-existence in the realm of protective picket fences and precocious yet insecure youngsters that are forced to battle this week\u2019s bombastic boogeyman that dares to interrupt their unappreciated lap of luxury.\r\n\r\n**Better Watch Out** should not be too concerned whether or not Santa is coming to town but in the case of the Satan-esque home intruders that want to sadistically spread some holiday jeer\u2026well folks that is another story entirely. The outgoing parents Robert and Deandra Lerner (TV veteran Patrick Warburton and Virginia Madsen) must leave their 12-year old son Luke (Levi Miller, \u201cPan\u201d) in the care of a babysitter in their absence. This suits Luke just fine because the babysitter in question happens to be his targeted object of affection going on so many years and counting. Luke\u2019s crush for his caretaker is immense and he feels fortunate enough to take advantage of her company while hoping to score some major points with her heart. After all, Luke is not a baby\u2013he\u2019ll be thirteen in a matter of weeks so his desired dreamgirl should accept him easier being a year older, right? Keep on dreaming, Lukester.\r\n\r\nThe vivacious Ashley (Olivia Dejonge, _The Visit_) is the recipient of Luke\u2019s innocent lust. The question remains: when can the eager Luke seal the deal and let his babysitting beauty know about his romantic feelings for her? Well, one must give Luke credit for trying to sway the older titillating teen to consider his lovey-dovey overtures towards her. Naturally Ashley finds all this rather awkward and amusing. However, as Luke\u2019s hopes for charming the socks off of Ashley go south there are other factors that are ruining his efforts to score with the treasured blonde babysitter. The distractions become gradually intrusive and overbearing. Random phone calls are deemed disturbing then finally there is sinister static occurring in and out of the house.  Before the dust settles with the dangerous distractions transpiring left and right the ultimate heinous happenings reaches its creepy climax as actual intruders are now front and center. Hence, the panicky Ashley must step up to the plate and protect her charge Luke and herself from these menacing misfits invading the Lerners\u2019 home. Does the babysitting bombshell have what it takes to be resourceful and defend these criminal cretins from bringing harm to the exposed household?\r\n\r\nIt would not be beneficial to elaborate further on the percolating plot in **Better Watch Out** for the violation of giving away too much that constitutes spoiling this film\u2019s twists and turns of eye-winking surprises and developments. However, one can certainly give glowing credit to the production crew and performers that collaborate and create an absurdist atmosphere of holiday-themed anarchy thus giving Watch a delicious devilish streak in its wild and whacked-out colorful violence. Peckover and co-writer Zach Kahn create this deliriously spunky acidic project laced with intentions of outwitting its audience trying to follow the dots of the off-the-cuff mayhem. Granted that the majority of unimaginative and faceless conveyor belt creep shows released from Hollywood\u2019s predictable playground is typical fright-light farces that more times than not insult if not properly engage the viewers. **Better Watch Out** challenges the masses with its promising fatalistic frivolity and rollicking ridicule as it mocks as much as salutes the twitchy-based goose-bump cinema it is aping with noted sardonic affection.\r\n\r\nAussie actress Dejonge, sporting a rather authentic American accent, is enjoyable as the feisty Ashley whose conviction to serve and protect the livelihood of her junior-sized puppy love pal from hellish harm is a marvel to experience. Dejonge\u2019s Ashley is not some scream queen airhead and grips the over-sized butcher knife in some some jittery scenes with all the conviction that does not suggest a dimwitted damsel-in-distress. Miller is relatable as the coming-of-age dweeb kid whose hormones snap, crackle and pop more than a super-sized bowl of Rice Krispies.  Still, one cannot blame the love-struck lad especially if you had Dejonge\u2019s hot-blooded teen tart guarding your safety from unknown forces on a blanketed snowy day in Anywhere, USA. Besides, Luke thinks of himself as Ashley\u2019s protector. Together, the jeopardized pair are absorbing as they face off against their destructive detractors.\r\n\r\nAlthough shown briefly, Warburton\u2019s Robert and Madsen\u2019s Deandra are a couple of welcomed tools as the bickering parents to wannabe smooth operator Luke. Ed Oxenbould dutifully shines as the obligatory best friend Garrett who is a tortured sideline witness to Luke\u2019s outlandish agenda for sweeping Ashley off of her feet. Thrown into the mix of the topsy-turvy crisis-driven storm are Ashley\u2019s tandem of boytoys from the present in Ricky (Aleks Mikic)  and past in Dacre Montgomery\u2019s Jeremy.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to kiss off the haunting but humorously heady **Better Watch Out** under the mistletoe because its infectious pucker for deadly delirium will be felt no matter where one is standing at the moment.\r\n\r\n**Better Watch Out** (2017)\r\n\r\nWell Go USA Entertainment\r\n\r\n1 hour 36 minutes\r\n\r\nSTARRING: Olivia Dejonge, Levi Miller, Ed Oxenbould, Virginia Madsen, Patric Warburton, Alek Mikic, Darce Montgomery\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR: Chris Peckover\r\n\r\nWRITER(S): Chris Peckover, Zack Kahn\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGENRE: Horror, Mystery & Suspense, Drama, Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng**",

            "Yuletide log slips from the fire to ignite the Xmas horror movie sub-genre.\r\n\r\nLets have it right, the 1/10 reviews are from hardcore horror fans who just didn't get the horror experience they was looking for. That's understandable, it's one of the toughest genres to please given the broadness available, but what of those who go in blind who are just after a bit of chilly yuletide nastiness?\r\n\r\nDirector Chris Peckover and his co-writer Zack Khan have given not just the Xmas horror film genre a shot in the arm, but also put a clever spin on the home invasion formula - the latter of which a formula that grew stale a long time ago. Now I can't vouch for trailers etc, so if folk have been misled then it's tough turkey at yuletide, but going in fresh without expectation levels - to just rock up for a viewing purely because it's an Xmas horror pic, then the rewards are plenty.\r\n\r\nThe makers make a move early to lay down a marker that all is not as it seems, and from there the surprises continue to flow with disturbing glee. We could argue it's in bad taste in this day and age as the fear of youth grows ever more acute, maybe? But it's a nice rug pull and the momentum never lets up right to the devilish resolution. Job done for me. Implausible probabilities and ridiculous actions in a horror film? Surely not... \r\n\r\nThis is funny in a dark way, cheekily troubling in its choice of protagonists to propel the piece, and it's nicely performed by the youthful cast. It's no Black Christmas or any other of those blood soaked Crimble horrors, this has a glint in its eye and amen to that. 7/10",
            "Fantastic watch, would watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that is almost impossible to talk about, it is so twisted and refreshing on so many levels.  Just the premise of a home invasion is enough to make for a potentially good movie on its own, which is why it's basically an entire genre to itself.  Adding a \"I'm going to seduce my babysitter\" on top of it makes it unique and interesting.\r\n\r\nEverything that happens past that is unpredictable, awesome, and refreshing.  Levi Miller, Ed Oxenbould, and (especially) Olivia DeJonge are great in there roles.\r\n\r\nThis is a great psychology horror movie that plays on several different aspects of life and human desires.\r\n\r\nIt is well worth the watch."

            "**The trouble that had never let her alone.**\r\n\r\nA story about America, Hollywood cast, but produced and directed by outsiders. A powerful film. Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.\r\n\r\nMaybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine. From one of the film poster, I thought it was Michael Sheen. Only realised while watching the film that it was Guy Pearce. From writing to the making, it was a very good film. But the story could make some people uneasy. Because everything that's happened between the people and their relationship, not for soft guys. Yet it is a must see thriller, a must see western.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",
            "A congregation dressed in black, hymns being sung flatly, an evil preacher, an abortion scene in the first 15 minutes... \r\nI should have known from the title that it wasn't the good western that the cover image conveyed. I could not make it through 20 minutes before I had to shut it off.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie which seems determined to slander the most beautiful message that exists - the message of Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nIt is also another point of evidence that rated \"R\" and \"MA\" movies simply means \"movies not worth poisoning your brain with\".\r\n\r\nThe actors were great. They played the roles well. But the subject material, the script, and the very idea of it is not worth consuming.\r\n\r\n**Psalm 10:4-6**\r\n\r\n**4** The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God:\r\nGod is not in all his thoughts.\r\n\r\n**5** His ways are always grievous; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight:\r\nAs for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.\r\n\r\n**6** He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved:\r\nFor I shall never be in adversity.",
            "An extremely grim and unsettling horror-Western with an interestingly structured plot, \u2018Brimstone\u2019 can be found either disgusting or superb; I'll go with the latter.\r\n\r\n8/10",
            "**A good Western, despite its weaknesses.**\r\n\r\nMany decades ago, Italian Western films were a huge success and guaranteed the careers of several actors, such as Clint Eastwood, and directors like Sergio Leone. This film, however, is neither Italian nor American: despite being spoken in English and featuring North American actors, it is a film directed by the Dutch (Martin Koolhoven and his team), shot in Spain and where Hungarians and Austrians also collaborated. Out of this Babel of nationalities, however, emerged a good Western film.\r\n\r\nThe plot is the strongest point of this film, which wonderfully works the epic style and a tension that grows, chapter by chapter (was I the only one to see in this chapter organization and non-linear narrative some influence by Tarantino?). I won't reveal too much about the plot, but I think I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment if I say that everything revolves around a young woman who tries to escape from a crazed Protestant pastor who is determined to kill her, no matter the place or the circumstances. The film builds an absolutely detestable and maniacal villain, and gives the female character the gifts and strength to defeat him, and to captivate us with sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe film is not perfect, there are logic flaws, continuity flaws and absurd situations. But the film nevertheless entertains the audience very well. Guy Pearce stands out the most, giving life to a captivating and execrable villain. The actor is excellent and gives us the best work of his career so far. Dakota Fanning holds the central female character and handles the task at hand well, but I felt several times that she doesn't have a challenging task. Kit Harrington can complain even more, since he saw his character killed early and didn't have time to show talent, despite the film being almost two and a half hours long.\r\n\r\nRegarding the length, I am of the opinion that it would have been better with about thirty minutes less, and that this denotes a certain sloppiness in the editing and in the selection of the scenes that should have been in the final cut. The film is impactful, it is quite violent, realistic and not suitable for teenagers, impressionable people and animal lovers (as far as I know, no one was hurt in the filming, but there are several intense scenes that include animals). The sets and costumes were very well-designed, despite the fact that the film works in a certain temporal limbo in which it is very difficult to have a sense of the time in which everything happens (somewhere between 1880 and 1910?). The scenarios are also very good, and the soundtrack was very well conceived.",
            "Yeah, another Western, had to wait for the wife to not be home so I could dive into a genre she hates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's odd how sex and nudity seem out of place in westerns given that in real life prostitution thrived. Historically a lot of what this film is about could be true. But... it doesn't feel like it should be in a Western. Racism and violence, yeah, those can make it in and feel right. Prostitution, certainly... but in a not seen sort of way.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know, it's a lot of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart with Clint Eastwood bringing up the rear that sort of defines the genre for people my age.\r\n\r\nThat being said... it's dark.\r\n\r\nBut it's done right, and it's well acted, and it plays on the emotions something fierce, it's well acted, it's moody. In other words it's an insanely well done movie, despite that fact that it deals with subject matter that you don't expect coming into a western.\r\n\r\nInsanely well done."

            "> **_Review on Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nThis indie sci-fi thriller Vivarium from Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is many things, one definitely being quite the head-scratcher. Not because of it being an intellectually challenging story, or one that is laced with twists and turns to create an unpredictable viewing, but a film that delivers a narratives so peculiar that it is like something you've never seen before. Take this with a pinch of salt, as there's certainly aspects which don't make the landing of such an ambitious plot, but let it also be known that Vivarium contains some impressions visual and narrative storytelling, enough to forgive some of the mid-act waffle that cripples the films momentum.\r\n\r\nFinnegan gets the ball rolling with power, keeping the story taught enough that we are thrown straight into the mystery early doors. This works extremely well as the tension begins to bubble within the first ten minute mark. The performances here from our main cast member already begin to show their brilliance, especially Jonathon Aris who sets a chilling foreshadowing tone with his appropriately eerie character Martin. The small (yet effective) amount of screen time we have with Martin is enough to set the tone, and we, like Tom and Gemma are forced to endure something that is so ominously intense that it leaves a lingering sense of dread.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this soon begins to simmer once Finnegan establishes the plot in its whole, and realisation settles on the simple fact that, after the 30 minute mark, there really isn't much else for the story to go. Yes the labyrinth maze of suburbia is strangely terrifying, and the strenuous repetition is effective, but after 15 minutes of having the child introduced, Vivarium begins to fall flat, and grow increasingly more stale up until after the sixty minutes in. The fantastic Poots and Eisenberg, and the deadpan humour do prevent this film from becoming a little too one-note, but this doesn't exuse more than a few scenes that will be a task to sit through, even in these current homebound world we are living in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a glimmer of brilliance in Finnegan's choice of release here, as what our main couple are enduring is poetically reflective of the life we are living in this mad pandemic virus. I found myself identifying with the irritated attitude our characters develop, and sympathised with them when their child (the boy) was well deserving of a slap. Vivarium is intelligently relative right now, and can definitely be perceived as as Finnegan holding a mirror up to the idealistic yet treacherous concept of what makes the perfect home, and the urge to be the perfect family.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there's so much underlying aspects of Vivarium that are so incredibly reflective of the inevitable repetition that comes once a spunky couple are weighed down by family life, securing their \"ideal\" home and tolerating each others impurities under the same roof constantly. Finnegan exposes the dangers of the nuclear family here, and forces us to endure it too, warts and all. We even get those little moments in which Tom consistently chips away, digging a whole, not to be talked to, helped or interrupted by Gemma, who becomes a slave to ensuring nothing but contentment for their boy. This moment is humourous with a dark sting, and will be reflective of reality to many, but to those inside Vivarium is nothing but a nightmarish loop.\r\n\r\nThis distorted utopia Finnegan creates is what's most effective, orchestrated by a Burton-esque palette that is as gorgeous as it is hauntingly off-kilter. The early 80's, Romero's Day of the \r\n\r\nDead-like synth is undeniably effective, and carries the tension through to the final act, which although doesn't hit a payoff point that excuses the slow middle act, does add to the bankers reality Finnegan has crafted, and highlights the eeriness established from the beginning. While Vivarium does lose a tone of momentum when it hits the mid-way point, by the time it reaches its end, I can't shake the distinct feeling of unease I had to endure for over eighty minutes, and I can't deny that a film like this was an experience I have quite been exposed to before. I have been feeling really under the weather these past few days, and let's just say this only made me feel worse. Great job, I guess?\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nVivarium is a simplistically disturbing suburban nightmare with a captivating story and little room for growth. Enduring its drab middle act may prove tricky, but once Finnegan blows the dust of the eerie intensity established from the beginning, you'll find there is much to be desired with this unsettling little indie-sci-fi thriller.",
            "Amazing watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nImogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg (both from \"The Art of Self Defense\") are amazing in their roles as an abducted couple force to raise a child.\r\n\r\nThis is an amazing premise (see \"Solar Opposites\" for something similar), and one that is extremely hard to discuss without spoilers. This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is \"adoption of a strange child\" trope, there is a \"troubled couple\" trope, there is even a mystery trope.\r\n\r\nI'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different \"Twilight Zone\" episodes.\r\n\r\nThe production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through.",
            "Sci-fi thriller, just not _\"on the edge of sit\"_ type. Lorcan Finnegan remakes his short film **Foxes** and adds a life message to it.",
            "It's a movie whose premise had promise but was never thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nI read the generally high praise in the reviews for this movie and admittedly, I was fooled. I'm convinced that at least the individual here who likened part of its premise to the animated series, \"Solar Opposites,\" while not being entirely off the mark, neglected to mention that unlike Solar Opposites, there is no payoff with Vivarium. Unlike Solar Opposites, we don't know why Vivarium exists. We don't know why people are expected to raise these mysterious hominids. We don't know what their purpose is, other than to entrap first home buyers, like some kind of otherworldly predatory lender. Is it a euphemism for unscrupulous property developers? Who knows?\r\n\r\nOnly thing I know is that by the end of it all, I felt totally ripped off. At around 90 minutes, it was 60 minutes too long. It's not even something that I can suggest is open to much interpretation.\r\n\r\nIf you just need something playing in the background while you're performing other work at home, even then it may be a stretch but it certainly doesn't deserve much better.",
            "Vivarium was eerie and creepy, and definitely a movie that will mess with your head, albeit probably in ways other than you anticipated. You'll be tricked in the beginning into believing this movie is actually a sociological observation of the slow and robotic death of suburban life: you and your nuclear family settle into middle class conformity in a large, seemingly endless design of mazes and hedges, condemned to repeat the endless cycle of home, school (or work), home, sleep, rinse and repeat. And it certainly gives one those unsettling vibes, especially when the creepy box with the build-a-baby arrives at their prison doorsteps.\r\n\r\nRather, this is something else entirely. While it does well maintaining that nearly subtle sense of wrongness, of something being terribly just _off_, in the end, you may find yourself somewhat disappointed, as it is at this precise moment the film becomes like every other movie of its kind out there. Quite possibly, it is the end that is the most disturbing, for it seems to insinuate that humanity is as disposable as livestock.",
            "A young couple go to an estate agent to seek out their dream home. They encounter the almost robotic \"Martin\" who offers to show them their ideal residence - and so off go Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg to inspect. They discover a typical detached house in the suburbs, surrounded by identical homes that leave them a bit cold. When their guide disappears, they decide to go home - except; they are caught in a labyrinthine network of streets that always brings them back to \"No. 9\". Soon, a baby in a box arrives and their happiness ought to be complete - except they have no other human contact and so slowly, but surely, start to go a bid mad. The kid has an infuriating habit of screaming loudly when he doesn't get what he wants - and I felt much like screaming myself as the cyclical pointlessness of this really dreary film did start to get on my nerves. Perhaps Lorcan Finnegan intended the potency of the sterility of the whole thing to engender a feeling of irritation from his audience; if he did then top marks. Otherwise, this is a total waste of the talents of two actors who could have found better ways to help us pass 100 minutes.",
            "\"Vivarium\" is one of those movies that pulls you in with an interesting concept but leaves you questioning everything, especially the choices the characters make. The story follows a couple who find themselves trapped in a seemingly endless suburban neighborhood, forced into a bizarre and unsettling routine. The mystery keeps you engaged, but the characters\u2019 decisions often feel frustrating. Not in a \"bad script\" way, but in a way that makes you wonder if they were written to be this passive on purpose. The pacing leans toward slow-burn horror, relying more on psychological unease than traditional scares.\r\n\r\nThe directing does a solid job of maintaining tension, making the whole thing feel claustrophobic and surreal. The cinematography enhances this with sterile, repetitive visuals that emphasize the artificiality of their world. Acting-wise, Imogen Poots delivers a strong performance, while Jesse Eisenberg brings his usual style, which sometimes works but occasionally feels forced. The real standout is the child actor, his unsettling presence adds a lot to the film\u2019s eerie atmosphere. There\u2019s a lot of subtlety in how he moves and reacts, making you wonder whether his voice was altered or dubbed over in post.\r\n\r\nThe script keeps things cryptic, and while that works for the tone, it also leaves some moments feeling underdeveloped. The lack of clear explanations may frustrate some viewers, but it\u2019s clear that the movie is more about the experience than the answers. The sound design plays a big role in the tension, using unsettling audio cues to make certain scenes even more uncomfortable. Overall, Vivarium is a strange, thought-provoking film that raises more questions than it answers. If you like psychological horror with a heavy dose of surrealism, it\u2019s worth a watch. Just don\u2019t expect everything to make sense."

            "**Man always needs a purpose.**\r\n\r\nSince the Hollywood upgraded to the 3D animation, the rest of the world took over and given some incredible films in the last one and half decades. The Japanese animes are undoubtedly the best, but the European animation, particularly the 2D animation started to boom in the recent times with special mention goes to Tomm Moore. So basically I might miss some Hollywood animations, right now, but I'm very watchful over this kind of films. That's how I watched it, but anyway I would have seen it.\r\n\r\nThis is the director's first feature animation film, but he was known for his awesome short animations which one of them won him an Oscar. It was jointly produced by three countries, including Japan's Studio Ghibli. It's their first non-Japanese production and a great beginning and timing to expand the production in other continents. Especially after their legend, Hayao Miyazaki retired from the filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe film was short like the 80 minute stretch without a single word spoken in its entire narration. There's no even sign language used, everything's actions and reactions. So you would find empty in the film's cast section which is kind of weird. I mean there are characters in the film, but all were imaginations without names and what year it takes place, where with so many questions like that. Basically to say, a film without the cast, but the crew members managed to give the best to the viewers to get it without any struggle.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, that the film is very enjoyable. It is a fantasy film, so whatever you see, you have to accept it. Because that's how things happen in a theme like this, all fictional. Though, the first thing you have to keep in your mind is not the entire film was an hallucination event. There are some dreamy events and that's fine since the film character is coping with loneliness.\r\n\r\nA man who had lost at sea, wakes up in a small island. It's a life supporting land mass with fresh water and fruits, but he also has to put some effort for fishing. His notion is to leave the island as soon as possible to go back to where he had come from, the civilised world. In his every attempt to sail with a raft he had made using bamboos, fails to cross after a certain stretch of the island coast. He later comes to know what stopped him and with an anger reaction he commits a mistake. So now he has to come out of the guilt and to do that he chooses what seems the right.\r\n\r\nIt was like a simple story without any meaning about everything that's shown in it. So in my entire watch I thought the same and said it was an okay film with great animation. But the ending changed my stance. That twist, I don't think everybody would understand. But one thing I want to make sure if you yet to see it, that it was about the purpose. The man always looks for a reason to do things and even to live or die. That's where the red turtle comes in.\r\n\r\nAlthough my biggest question is, is this film a follow-up or in any way connected to the director's previous short animation 'Father and Daughter'? Because it seems the man who got lost in the sea is from that short film. But it never revealed the reason why he was stopped by whomever from return home. Also, both the conclusions syncs. It's just a my theory, so only the director can explain that.\r\n\r\nI'm very sure this film is in the Oscars race. If it fails to make, then its not my prediction was wrong, but the Academy Awards people got it all wrong. I'm also sure it won't win as 3D animation dominated world, particularly 'Zootopia' 'Finding Dory' and 'Moana' are taking the first three frontrunner spots. Except the technical differences, only the grown ups can say this one has a better and meaningful story. It is very similar to 'Ponyo', but a grown-up's version. Anyway, it is a must see film, especially the adults and in particular those who always think animation is for children. If they see it, they might change their mind. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n8/10",
            "The Red Turtle is a dialogue free film. That may turn a lot of people off. However, it fit the mood of the movie perfectly. It's a fantasy film that is filled with pure undefiled love. You will find yourself wanting your own family after this one. The ending is left open to interpretation but only makes the plot seem that much more interesting when you try to unravel who/what is the Red Turtle. A definite watch for those looking for more than the typical Hollywood blockbuster.",
            "A young man finds himself shipwrecked on a tropical island with only the coconuts and friendly, mischievous, fauna for company. He's pretty ill-equipped for his new lifestyle and is gradually starving! What to do? Well he has a go at building a raft, but each time he sets off it ends up as little more than kindling. After one such incident, he concludes that his antagonist is a beautiful sea turtle that he has observed nearby. When it comes onto land one day, he flips it over and leaves it to perish in the hot sun. Magic has an hand to play now, though, as the creatures morphs into a young woman with whom he gradually starts to bond and... The animation and soundtrack on this dialogue-free feature are gorgeous. The story itself has a brevity and engagingly fantastic nature to it. What makes something paradise? What keeps something paradise? It felt a little long at ninety minutes and don't be expecting any great conclusions at the end, but it still flew by and I really liked it's simplicity.",

            "\"The Red Turtle: A Meditation on Be Here Now\"\r\n\r\nIn Michael Dudok de Wit's masterful animated film, a simple narrative becomes a profound exploration of human resilience and spiritual surrender. Without a single spoken word, the film communicates a universal truth: we are precisely where we are meant to be, even when that reality feels like a constraint.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a castaway on a deserted island, initially consumed by the urge to escape. His repeated attempts to build rafts, only to have them mysteriously destroyed, mirror our human tendency to resist our current circumstances. The red turtle - more a spiritual guide than a mere animal - becomes the catalyst for transformation.\r\n\r\nVisually stunning, with a delicate, watercolor-like animation style, the film breathes life into its minimalist landscape. Each frame is meticulously composed, each movement deliberate. The timing is exquisite, allowing moments of tension and release to resonate deeply.\r\n\r\nWhat elevates this film is its universal message: true liberation comes not from fighting our situation, but from accepting it. The protagonist's journey is less about physical survival and more about spiritual awakening.\r\n\r\nA profound, poetic meditation on life's cycles and the art of being present."

            "**_An impressive eco-thriller that could do with more clearly delineated characters_**\r\n\r\n>_It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life._\r\n\r\n- Rachel Carson; _The Sea Around Us_ (1951)\r\n\r\n>_From the ocean came a roar of passions that seemed to have broken through all barriers: 'We must procreate and multiply! We must exhaust all the powers of lust!' The waves glowed like lava, and I imagined I could see multitudes of living beings \u2013 algae, whales, sea monsters \u2013 revelling in an orgy, from the surface to_ _the bottom of the sea. Immortality was the law here._\r\n\r\n- Isaac Bashevis Singer; \"Hanka\"; from _Passions and Other Stories_ (1975)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from writer/director Neasa Hardiman, _Sea Fever_ examines such issues as humanity's disregard for the size of our ecological footprint, the knee-jerk argument that if something hitherto unknown can't be exploited for profit then it should be destroyed, and Mankind's utter insignificance in the face of the wonders of nature. Heavily influenced by David Cronenberg's body horror films, Ridley Scott's _Alien_ (1979), and John Carpenter's _The Thing_ (1982), it could do with some refinement, especially in terms of characterisation, and the _d\u00e9nouement_ is a little anticlimactic, but Hardiman gets the atmosphere spot on, and overall, this is an impressive debut.\r\n\r\nSiobh\u00e1n (Hermione Corfield with a gorgeous head of red hair and a decent Irish accent) is an all-work-and-no-play doctoral student studying marine biology, specifically anomalous ecological patterns. A socially awkward introvert, she's not at all happy with she's told that she needs to get practical experience outside the lab and so her professor has organised for her to join a fishing boat and monitor their haul. The boat in question, the _Niamh Chinn-\u00d3ir_, is owned by Freya (Connie Nielsen) and captained by her husband Gerard (Dougray Scott), but it hasn't been doing too well recently and money is tight. However, Gerard has been tracking a huge shoal of fish and believes their luck is about to change. Meanwhile, Siobh\u00e1n gets to know the crew; Ciara (the always spectacular Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9), her son Johnny (Jack Hickey), genius engineer Omid (Ardalan Esmaili), and the baby of the group, Sudi (Elie Bouakaze). Upon sailing, Gerard sees that the shoal has moved into an exclusion zone, but without telling anyone, he too enters the zone. No sooner has he done so when the _Niamh_ hits something and becomes entangled. Investigating the collision, Siobh\u00e1n is stunned to see huge bioluminescent tentacles arising from the deep and attached to the hull. Back on board, she's thrilled to announce they may have encountered a creature unknown to science, but when it becomes apparent that the tentacles are secreting dangerous microscopic parasites onto the _Niamh_, the crew find themselves in a fight for survival, where their greatest enemy is one another.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fhianna\u00edocht_ [Fenian Cycle] of Irish mythology, Niamh Chinn \u00d3ir [Niamh of the Golden Hair] is the daughter of Manann\u00e1n mac Lir, king of the Otherworld, T\u00edr na n\u00d3g [Land of the Young]. Upon falling in love with Ois\u00edn, son of Fionn mac Cumhaill, Niamh returns with him to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, where they spend three happy years, although in the real world, 300 years have passed. Wanting to see his homeland again, Ois\u00edn persuades Niamh to let him return to Ireland. She gives him her horse, \u00c9nbarr, but warns him not to dismount and touch the soil or the spell of youth from T\u00edr na n\u00d3g will be broken. After finding his childhood home on _Cnoc Al\u00faine_ desolate, he is helping some men move a large stone when he falls from \u00c9nbarr and immediately turns into an old man. Before he dies, Ois\u00edn encounters Saint P\u00e1draig, telling him the stories of the _fianna_. The relevance for _Sea Fever_ is fairly obvious; the exclusion zone is T\u00edr na n\u00d3g and the _Niamh_ is Ois\u00edn, going somewhere it shouldn't be, a place which will fundamentally change it. The possibility of the Niamh returning to Ireland carrying an infection correlates with Ois\u00edn being 'infected' with age if he touches the soil of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn a post-screening Q&A with Hardiman at the film's Irish premi\u00e8re, she specifically said that one of the main impetuses behind the story was to offer a corrective for films which demonise or are critical of the scientific method, to challenge narratives which \"_depict the scientific method as being cut-off, antisocial, self-important, and irrelevant_\". In this sense, there's a lot more hard real-world science than you might expect \u2013 from details of Siobh\u00e1n's research and her explanations of marine biology, biodiversity, and anomalous patterns to some fairly detailed discussions of the possible biochemistry of the creature that ensnares the _Niamh_, hypotheses as to why it behaves the way it does, and detailed depictions of how the parasites enter and exit the bloodstream (how they exit is not for the faint at heart). In the latter half of the film, a lot of time is given over to discussions of whether the _Niamh_ should head back to Ireland, with Siobh\u00e1n trying to make the others understand the devastating ramifications that could result from introducing the parasites into a population centre. All of this doesn't quite position the film in the realm of science-fact, but it certainly helps to lend the narrative a stronger sense of real-world verisimilitude.\r\n\r\nScience is also important thematically insofar as one of the main issues explored is that the creature may not be acting aggressively in attaching to the _Niamh_; it's simply trying to survive, and even the parasites aren't a form of attack. In this way, Hardiman refuses to demonise the creature, and from the moment of its discovery, Siobh\u00e1n consistently argues that the crew must protect it, which is not what you expect from this type of film. On the other hand, Gerard sees it in more black and white terms; initially as something to be used for profit, and later as something to be destroyed \u2013 capitalism at its finest. There are no real villains as such, but on a sliding moral scale, the creature is above several of the human characters.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, there's a merciful absence of jump scares and, apart from one scene, there's very little gore. Instead, the film's horror elements are based more in the intricate sound design, Ray Ball's production design, and Ruair\u00ed O'Brien's cinematography. The three work in tandem to make it impossible for the viewer to ever forget that we're on a ship isolated at sea \u2013 from the constant creaking and sound of lapping water to the claustrophobic quarters (the _Niamh_ is so small, it only has four beds) to the handheld and often dimly lit photography that imbues every shadow with a sense of the unknown. Indeed, as was the _USCSS Nostromo_ in _Alien_ and U.S. Outpost 31 in _The Thing_, the rusty and battered _Niamh_ (a vessel which has clearly seen better days) is very much a character in _Sea Fever_, and its aesthetic design is pivotal in allowing Hardiman to achieve a sense of psychological unease.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the most significant is that even given the small cast, there isn't a huge amount of character differentiation. Even Siobh\u00e1n is never really developed, whilst the _Niamh_'s crew are largely interchangeable. One of the reasons films like _Alien_ and _The Thing_ are considered classics is because of how good the character individualisation is \u2013 every person in both of those films is a distinct individual with an interiority and a clearly defined set of character traits that sets him or her apart from the others; pick any character, and you'll be able to talk about who that character is as a person, from the take-charge and rational Dallas (Tom Skerritt) to the reactionary Parker (Yaphet Kotto) in _Alien_, from the by-the-book and eerily calm Garry (Donald Moffat) to the hot-headed Childs (Keith David) in _The Thing_. Their traits aren't painted in minutiae, but they are painted in strokes clearly differentiated from the others. A failure to recreate this is one of the main reasons that Scott's _Prometheus_ (2012) is such a pile of tripe wherein no one is differentiated from anyone else and no one acts consistently because none of them have dominant character traits. _Sea Fever_'s script is a lot better than that rubbish, but it's still very light on individualisation, which makes it harder to care about these people, which makes them feel expendable, a potential death sentence for a film of this nature. Thankfully, it doesn't come to that here, but with just a little more work on the screenplay, the whole film could really have been elevated into something truly special. Another small gripe I have is that the conclusion is pretty anticlimactic; it works very well thematically, but it's a bit weak in terms of drama or tension, and it feels somewhat rushed.\r\n\r\nMixing body-horror with elements of a creature-feature garnished with some eco-friendly themes, _Sea Fever_ is a very enjoyable film and an impressive debut feature. Although its broader genre beats offer nothing we haven't seen before, it still manages to feel like its own thing with its own things to say. It could do with a better balance in terms of the plot/characterisation ratio, but the unexpected focus on science and ecological themes mean it rises above the monster movie clich\u00e9s you might expect, which should help it to stand out in a crowded field.",
            "It has a promising plot but somehow it lacked substance, especially towards the end of the film. Somehow I was expecting a conclusion to the entire \u201cmonster\u201d situation, but then it was left unattended.\r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching the film though. Would I watch it again? No. Would I make my friends watch it? Possibly.",
            "Ultimately, while it gets a boost of inadvertent timeliness from the COVID-19 climate of pandemic paranoia, face-touching phobia and quarantined cabin fever, 'Sea Fever' is a fairly straightforward, even generic, blue-collar-workers-in-peril thriller.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-sea-fever-paranoia-parasitic-plagues-and-pandemic-horror",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's the first thing I've watched recently that didn't feel like they could (and should) shave an hour off of it. A nice, light watch that had a unique concept and a likable cast. I agree with others that the eye popping scene was about as intense as it got, with everyone else dying in fairly lackluster ways. I'm not normally one to say up the gore, but a bit more would have made the second half feel more intense and urgent.\r\n\r\nI also couldn't help but find it amusingly relevant to the current world \"situation\" with Siobh\u00e1n urging everyone to quarantine themselves and think about the greater good over themselves. If she only knew what an impossible task that is.",
            "Obviously done on a shoestring budget, this is actually quite an interesting little sci-fi/horror mystery. It all centres around the crew of a stranded trawler who come to realise that there is a malevolent beastie that has found it's way into their water supply after their boat strayed into a restricted area. Luckily \"Siobh\u00e1n\" (Hermione Corfield) has some scientific skills and plans a way to stop this lethal parasite from killing (rather messily) not just the people on the boat, but anyone they come into contact to. Rather prudently, it does not try to blow us away with fancy special effects. The use of light on the water and some basic microbe imagery conjures enough just enough sense of menace to keep the plot interesting; as do the efforts from a confident Corfield alongside Dag Malmberg and Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 - and Jack Hickey is quite easy on the eye, too! The script is nobody's finest work, and it is a mite too long - but it delivers well enough within it's limitations and kills 90 minutes on the television fine."

            "As I did in my review of the first instalment, in this movie series I should probably point out that I have not read the books. Some people claim that this movie do not follow the books but, obviously, I cannot comment on that. So my review is based on the movie and the movie alone. I have to confess that I mostly watched this movie because I did watch the first instalment and felt obliged to see where the story went.\r\n\r\nThis movie have quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube with the message to the inhabitants in the closed up city. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nAs with Divergent I found this movie to be fairly mediocre. One reviewer said that this was a movie dumbed down for the teenage audience. Unfortunately I feel that he was right. Also unfortunately I think many teenagers are a lot smarter than Hollywood believe they are.\r\n\r\nThe plot is, well, mediocre. The acting is fairly meh. The main character, Tris, really lacks any form of charisma and spends most of the movie going around in some state of melancholy feeling sorry for herself and everything that happens around her. Apart from Four most of the people were behaving immaturely, cluelessly, froze up or panicked whenever something nasty happened and switched allegiances back and forth like you changed shirts.\r\n\r\nWhen Tris finally opened the cube I was expecting something cool and unexpected. What we got was a rather dull message about the city and its \u201cpurpose\u201d. I complained in my review of divergent that we got absolutely no background information as to how the people had ended up in this ridiculous situation with a closed city and these factions that I still do not understand what they were supposed to solve. The message was supposed to explain this but it explained absolutely nothing except that the divergents were some kind of purpose or solution.\r\n\r\nThe ending? Well again this is a book series so it is not surprising that it ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger but it was really a cheap ending, one that you would expect from a TV series episode.\r\n\r\nSo I cannot say that I liked the movie very much. The virtual reality special effects scenes were fairly cool but that was about it.",
            "Briefing; this movie is just bad.\r\n\r\nThe first was not good either but this one continues the path open by the first. The special effects are quite noticeably rendered by computers and the actors are uncharismatic, other than that, the plot is just bad.\r\n\r\nAnother movie with quasi-teenager lead roles in a dystopic future in which stupidity is spread all along man-kind.\r\n\r\nWe just witness the struggle of our heroine with her self-imposed guilt with stupid enemies that let her survive at every moment so she can become the messiah she is meant to be.\r\n\r\nI think the only positive part I can get from this movie is the preeminence of strong and important female characters. Other than that, just skip it.",
            "> The mystery box and the power hungry leaders!\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad sequel, I quite enjoyed it, but I think I liked 'Divergent' better. The story continued a very short after where it ended in the first. In this part, it was all about power hungry where many try to get that top post. On the other side, there will be an attempt to open a mystery box that found which might reveal some important detail about them.\r\n\r\nLooked like a very good storyline, unpredictable stuffs, but not utilised to its full potential. Though the actors were good, especially Shailene was sexy in her short hairs. I think she came straight out of 'The Fault in Our Stars' to take up this role where her brother in this film was a boyfriend in that.\r\n\r\nVisually as well very captivating with those great graphics and it is first digital 3D film in the series. It has numerous small twists, especially during decrypting the mystery box. So I felt the middle parts were the best part of the film.\r\n\r\nI thought this film would take place outside the wall, but a new story was developed and still kept the mystery about the rest of the world. I don't know the book, but that's my disappointment. I hope the next film in the series would go beyond the wall and explore some new things. So I'm looking forward for the 'Allegiant'.\r\n\r\n6/10",

Now I could think of worse people to be on the run with as they traverse the wreckage of Chicago trying to find some allies to assist them in thwarting the dominant aspirations of the \"Erudite\" group who want to take over the world. To add to their woes, the menacing spectre that is \"Eric\" (Jai Courtney) is leading their would-be captors and so battle lines are quickly drawn. Except, well, they aren't really. This is a predicable and weak story made watchable by a sufficient soup\u00e7on of eye-candy and some perfectly choreographed, CGI augmented, action scenarios that do at least keep the pace moving for what did seem like a long-old two hours. There's some yellow duplicity from \"Peter\" (Miles Teller) to inject a little jeopardy, but that's all a bit of a damp squib when subsumed into the rest of this underwhelming adaptation of a series of novels that really did leave better to the imagination than Robert Schwentke has managed to concoct for us here. It's harmless fun to watch on the television when you're doing the ironing or writing your thesis on thermonuclear fission - it's not really worth watching for itself, though.",
            "Insurgent is a decent follow-up in the Divergent series, keeping up the action and world-building while introducing new conflicts. The plot moves at a solid pace, but it sometimes feels like it\u2019s setting up something bigger without fully delivering on it. There\u2019s a clear act structure, but some moments lack the depth needed to really hit. Certain character arcs, especially in terms of growth and decision-making, feel a bit underdeveloped, which makes some story beats feel forced rather than earned. The directing keeps things engaging with a mix of intense action and emotional moments, though the execution doesn\u2019t always match the ambition.\r\n\r\nShailene Woodley carries the film with a strong performance, making Tris a compelling lead even when the script doesn\u2019t give her much to work with. The supporting cast is solid, though some characters, particularly Miles Teller\u2019s, make choices that don\u2019t fully make sense. Visually, the cinematography and VFX are well done, especially in key action sequences where the effects shine. The score and sound design do a great job of elevating the tension and giving the film a more immersive feel. Overall, Insurgent is entertaining with good performances and visuals, but it struggles with depth in its storytelling and character development."

            "Lots of rocks everywhere...\r\n\r\nIt's CGI destruction time as Dwayne Johnson battles earthquakes and a tsunami to go rescue his daughter - with estranged wife in tow of course.\r\n\r\nDisaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing more than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden dialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a remake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with the time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side Johnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what is a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10",

            "This is a classical Hollywood movie, thin plot and a lot of effects. However, this time, I quite liked it. Actually I liked it a lot. The plot, although thin, is not altogether bad, it holds together even though are quite a few unbelievable moments. However, put in the context of a traditional disaster movie, it is not bad.. Maybe this is what I like about the movie. It is really a good old fashioned disaster movie.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read the blurb about this movie I was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a \u201cslow\u201d search for Ray\u2019s daughter. It is nothing of the kind. It has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes \u2026 and then it continues. I was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but I was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. The special effects are not however. At least, I liked them. Not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. I also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when Ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. I found that quite cool. There are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. For instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. The we have when Ray and his wife speeds through the waters of Los Angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. The amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. But then, I think I am too much of an engineer now.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ray\u2019s wife. That was one of the things I really did not like with the movie. Maybe the movie directors and actors in Hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a \u201cstandard\u201d plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other \u201cordinary\u201d people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the US apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from Hollywood all the time) and I really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and TV-shows! I was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and I do like \u201cThe Rock\u201d.\r\n\r\nSo after, after that little outburst, I have to say that I this one was a really enjoyable movie. One of the few lately that I have watched. It is a quite good, classical, disaster movie with a good build up, really good effects and a good and happy ending (for the main characters at last) and I am a sucker for happy endings.",
            "Solid enough, if not overly long, disaster movie. Dwayne Johnson is... well Dwayne Johnson but has more than enough charisma to carry this and never a bad thing having BOTH Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario either. Some of the effects were pretty good, others a bit iffy however. Still, I enjoy these disaster movies and while it doesn't measure up to The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno, but entertaining nonetheless. **3.5/5**"

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nOnce again, I didn\u2019t know anything going into the theater regarding this movie. In fact, Ready or Not wasn\u2019t even on my watchlist until the beginning of this week. I thought it was just going to be a passable and cheap horror flick, but the tremendously positive feedback from everyone around the world convinced me to give it a go. Fortunately, I wasn\u2019t disappointed! Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett deliver a dumb yet entertaining film with a childish yet fun concept never really explored in the gruesome and bloody way they do.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s one of those movies which the only flaw they might have has to do with the viewer\u2019s expectations. You\u2019ll only dislike this story if you don\u2019t accept its lighthearted tone. If you go in expecting a film filled with truly terrifying and scary sequences, you won\u2019t get that. If you go in expecting a movie with a dark vibe and tonally heavy scenes, you won\u2019t get that. It\u2019s one of the most common issues that audiences have all over the world: unrealistic expectations. After watching the trailers, it\u2019s clear that Ready or Not was always marketed as a horror-comedy with more emphasis on the dumb fun that the concept inevitably provides, so don\u2019t expect something the producers didn\u2019t even think of doing.\r\n\r\nHaving that in mind, the film definitely delivers what it promises. It\u2019s a fast-paced hide-and-seek game, filled with suspenseful scenes and genuinely funny moments. Its short runtime doesn\u2019t really let us care about every character, but to be fair, it\u2019s not like it truly matters in this case. Samara Weaving plays the bride who has to hide while the rest of the family tries to find her. Overall, everyone gives good performances, but Weaving completely steals the show with fantastic reactions to different situations, always making space for an extra laugh.\r\n\r\nDespite the unique exploration of a strange premise, it has a pretty generic and even formulaic development, which is a bit of a letdown. Granted, the ending is, well, unexpected in the way that it is executed, but its final result is still very predictable. There\u2019s a lot of cheesy moments, some do work, but others aren\u2019t near as effective. The score is actually one of the surprises since it\u2019s not usual for this feature to have such an impact in a rather simple movie. It provides a few chuckles with some witty lyrics, and it helps with elevating the suspense in the more tense sequences. It\u2019s also mostly well-shot and set in one-location, something I always deeply appreciate. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Ready or Not accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a fun and entertaining 90-minute hide-and-seek game like we\u2019ve never seen before. Its R rating lets its makers do whatever they please with the amount of blood and goriness present in a scene, which ultimately culminates in a jaw-dropping, hilarious ending. Samara Weaving is brilliant as the main character, carrying the whole film on her shoulders. Is it cliche? Yes. Is it formulaic and predictable? Yes. Is it cheesy? Hell, yes. However, this movie never intended to be a groundbreaking achievement in the genre. It just wants to deliver good fun. And it does.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

Just over 12 hours later, Connor Betts murdered nine people and injured 17 in a mass shooting in Dayton, OH. On August 10, Universal Pictures announced they had pulled Craig Zobel's eagerly awaited film _The Hunt_ from its scheduled release date on September 27. Telling the story of 12 strangers who are hunted for the amusement of a group of wealthy elites, in the wake of the shootings, the film had been accused by hysterical conservatives of portraying liberal elites hunting Donald Trump supporters. On August 7, for example, Matt Margolis of _PJ Media_ wrote,\r\n\r\n>_in the past few days we've been hearing a lot about how Donald Trump's rhetoric is apparently to blame for the El Paso shooting, yet Hollywood apparently lacked the foresight to think that a movie promoting violence against \"deplorables\" might be in bad taste until after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton._\r\n\r\nHe also claimed, incorrectly, that the film was originally called _Red State Vs. Blue State_, before concluding,\r\n\r\n>_apparently, some in Hollywood are more than willing to promote violence against Trump supporters. Meanwhile, Democrats and liberals in the media want us to believe that it's Trump's rhetoric that needs to be toned down._\r\n\r\nOn August 9, Trump himself tweeted, \"_the movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos_\" (as opposed to his own balm-like rhetoric, which is renowned for bringing people together), saying of Hollywood in general, \"_they create their own violence, and then try to blame others. They are the true Racists, and are very bad for our Country!_\" (because responding to a mass shooting by condemning a film you haven't seen makes way more sense than, oh, I don't know, tightening gun laws and outlawing the indefensible sale of automatic weaponry to the public. Way more sense).\r\n\r\nSo, what does any of this have to do with _Ready or Not_? Well, it's just curious that _Ready or Not_ has a very similar plot (elites hunting common folk), yet it has arrived in theatres without the slightest hint of controversy. Of course, despite what right-wing commentators would have us think about _The Hunt_, the theme of elites hunting the less privileged is nothing new. As far as I'm aware, it was first explored in Richard Connell's short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\" (1924). And now in _Ready or Not_, except with tongue firmly in cheek. Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy (aka Ryan Murphy), and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, _Ready or Not_ is a horror-comedy and a social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief prologue, the film cuts to the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien). The Le Domas family started out printing playing cards but earned its fortune making board games, and the family has now become decadently wealthy, owning several sports franchises (when Grace asks Alex if they refer to themselves as an \"empire\", he half-jokingly says they prefer the term \"dominion\"). Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, even though he's in line to inherit the business, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His return to the fold has made his mother Becky (Andie McDowell) especially happy, and she makes sure Grace knows how appreciative she is. Alex's father, Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) is more ambivalent; he's polite and respectful to Grace, but she's convinced he doesn't like her. There's no such ambiguity with Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), Tony's sister, who makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), but who is deeply thankful that he has Alex back in his life. Offering Grace a get-out-of-jail card just prior to the wedding, Alex tells her if she wants to leave, he will let her go. She dismisses the offer, however, and the two are wed. Shortly thereafter, Alex and Daniel's cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch Bradley (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun) arrive at the estate, apologising for missing the ceremony. It's at this point that Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace \u2013 whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity got checkers when she married Daniel). Alex is worried that Grace might get the hide and seek card, but Tony assures him that's highly unlikely \u2013 stating that in his lifetime, only one person has ever gotten that card; Helene's husband (something of which we saw in the prologue). At a disturbingly austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and so the game can commence\u2026and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (_sans_ Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry. This is no ordinary game of hide and seek.\r\n\r\nThe film's various psychoanalytical/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious \u2013 a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric/fempowerment celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic dismantling of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing). In this sense, each time Grace evades capture or strikes back against her pursuers, she is chipping away at the foundation of everything in which the Le Domas family believe, quite literally deconstructing the very concepts of marriage and old-world patriarchy.\r\n\r\nConcerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Maybe their wealth is built on the suffering of others in a very literal sense and maybe the difficulty they have accepting it when someone who they see as their social inferior marries into their circle manifests itself in actual violence. Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; sure, they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful. But so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt \u2013 people like Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.\r\n\r\nThis all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who may, or may not, be Satan. Le Bail promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than \"_tradition...reasons_\". The film makes no bones about the fact that the family is comically inept, and it gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon \u2013 from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up \"how to use a crossbow\" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon (more on this in a moment).\r\n\r\nAnother theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh, who is described in _The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness_, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, as the \"King of Evil\" and the \"Prince of Darkness\", and who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depiction of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace, which is defined by _ChristianEducation.org_ as,\r\n\r\n>_a sharing in the divine life. It is the infused presence of God, a presence that is supernatural, not merely natural. Human persons are not born in a state of grace. And there is nothing we can do ourselves to earn grace. Rather, divine grace is favour, and it is freely bestowed._\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, which is a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon them the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10; \"_Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer it as a sin offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness._\") Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.\r\n\r\nLooking at some other problems, despite its themes, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny (especially her comment after the second one, \"_why does this keep happening to me_\"). Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it. In _Natural Born Killers_ (1994), Oliver Stone gets away with asking the audience to laugh at horrific violence because he's fairly consistent in depicting all violence as funny (whether it's being shot by a bullet that stops in mid-air, getting drowned in a fish tank and simultaneously beaten with a tire-iron, having a perfectly circular hole shot through your hand, or having your head literally ripped off by rioting inmates). Here, the film picks and chooses when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence, which is problematically inconsistent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will (it may say more about me than the film). Although _Ready or Not_ is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Is it the greatest horror-comedy of all time? Good Lord, no. Indeed, it doesn't have much in the way of scares at all. But it sure is funny, allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion on occasion. With atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to an insularity from modernity, preventing the work-a-day world from entering their gated estates. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.",

Story-wise, not groundbreaking but as someone who generally doesn't enjoy dark comedies, this one worked for me. **3.5/5**",
            "I've never kept it secret that I have a personal issue with Samara Weaving, but I try to keep things like that out of my mind, and, even though I know it's impossible to be truly objective about something as subjective as art, at least attempt to be **impartial**.

Pretty good. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is such a great crazy, survivalist premise: an average lady that just wants to marry her man gets served up into a human hunting game, and she's a bad ass.  Samara Weaving nails every aspect of this role.  I did recognize a couple other actors: Melanie Scrofano (Wyanna Earp), Adam Brody, and Andie MacDowell, but none of the family really stands out other than Melanie, and that is more of circumstance, but they put the right person in that role at least.\r\n\r\nThe setting is limited to the estate grounds, but even if they built the sets for that place, it is bloody amazing and lends to the visuals both when they're displaying the house as being expansion and when they're showing it as a trap.\r\n\r\nI'm actually short on words to why it is as good as it is, the writing is top notch and the set it great, but the acting is only good (other than Samara), and there aren't huge effects.  Maybe it's the subtly of the effects they do show, and the details they go into in both presentation of the scene and the chosen dialogue.  This movie definitely creates a permeable atmosphere for the audience.\r\n\r\nIf you're okay with blood / gore / violence, then give it a go, it should be a good time.",
            "The excellent Samara Weaving is the antithesis of a scream queen. With kick-ass roles in \"The Babysitter,\" \"Mayhem,\" and \"Guns Akimbo,\" she is vying with Harley Quinn as the \"vixen\" of modern cinema. An outrageous story with just the right balance of camp and horror, \"Ready or Not\" is a fun romp through the worst-ever wedding night.",
            "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\r\nGood solid entertainment. Nothing really special, or twisty, but a great execution (unfortunately rare these days). This is how movies like Boss Level or Wrath of Man should've been made. \r\n\r\n* Short runtime \u2705\r\n* Never slows down \u2705",
            "When \"Grace\" (Samara Weaving) marries \"Alex\" (Mark O'Brien) she thinks it will be the happiest day of her life. Gathered at his family's sprawling mansion, the ceremony is followed by a small dinner at which \"Tony\" (Henry Czerny) announces that it is traditional on such occasions to play a game. A game of hide and seek. A lethal, deadly and downright dangerous game of hide and seek with poor, unsuspecting, \"Grace\" the target. The family count to two hundred then set off with all sorts of weapons (they cannot use guns nor the house's security cameras) to eliminate her. With her newlywed husband securely tied to the bed after he tried to help her, and still clad in her wedding dress, she must find a way to avoid execution and escape the grisly fate that awaits her. Luckily for her, \"Dan\" (Adam Brody) is a little less sold on the game so perhaps, just perhaps, she has a chance? Weaving reminded me a little of Margot Robbie as she gradually adapts to her perilous scenario, and what ensues is actually quite entertaining with some fun contributions from the pursuing family - \"Becky\" (Andie MacDowell) and \"Charity\" (Elyse Levesque). The film looks good, is well paced after a shaky start and a house riddled with secret passages provides an solid template for the drama to unfold. It does have something of the theatrical to it, but that's quite effective as it builds to quite an enjoyably fitting conclusion. It's not laugh out loud, but is certainly worth ninety minutes of your time and is way better than the contemporary, silmilarly styled, \"Knives Out\".",

This film has Scream\u2019s dark humor dripping from every kill, every snarky one-liner, and every fully embraced horror trope. Ready or Not is a beautiful mixture of Scream, Clue, and The Most Dangerous Game, all held together by Samara Weaving\u2019s fantastic performance. Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett are the masters of taking over used horror tropes and using them to tease and subvert expectations creating dark, fun, and tense movies that delight any horror fan. Ready or Not does just that with a story that feels familiar and surprising, recognizable and innovative, resulting in an original slasher filled with charm and chills.",
            "**The evil of money, a brutal carnage and a marriage for love in a movie of ups and downs.**\r\n\r\nHow many times we, common contributors, do not think of the hypothetical dark side that would like to exist in those rich families of business, politics and the arts? For many people, envy is very natural. Others, like me, are more concerned with the lawful origin of fortunes (what matters to me is that the rich honestly earn their money, the rest I feel it does not concern me) and others think that, since money is so earthly and perhaps evil, all great fortunes have some dose of perversity. Unlike people like me, who face money as a tool that can be well used or not, there are a lot of people who associate this malevolent load with money.\r\n\r\nThis movie begins around this wealthy family and creates a story of Satanism, carnage and lack of scruples. Everything is set on the wedding of the Patriarch's firstborn son. The young bride, for his family to accept her, will have to play a mysterious traditional game that they all have to play at a given moment. A crazy initiation ritual in a hunting room full of weapons and embalmed animals. What follows is the predictable carnage. And I say predictable because the movie is stupidly easy to guess, which is the weak point of the plot. As a horror movie, it will only work for those who have a weak stomach for bloody scenes: yes, the movie has a lot of gore, but I've seen worse.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the movie has its ups and downs. Taking advantage of the places that the production has achieved to shoot in Canada, including a famous museum-mansion, sets and costumes are excellent and worthy of a much more expensive thing. It is not a low-budget movie, it is obvious the producer has invested in the project, but it does not seem to be the first bet for a movie season: convincing and effective visual and sound effects help a lot and the editing was well performed. The soundtrack has its moments, but in contrast, cinematography is excessively trembled and occasionally poorly framed.\r\n\r\nWith such apparently heavy bets, it was a shame to feel the production went to seek a third-ranking cast. The protagonists are not bad, but they lack the experience of first water projects with more calloused colleagues: Samara Weaving made a secondary character in \u201cThree Billboards\u2026\u201d, Mark O'Brian went to do another in \u201cArrival\u201d and Adam Brody participated In \u201cMr. & Mrs. smith \u201d, but it's that. They are actors competing for their space in the sunlight, a rightful desire, but without experience and perhaps a little raw. Truth be told, the movie also does not give them challenging characters or complex situations. The best actress here is Andie MacDowell, but it is far from showing the qualities we saw in her oldest work. Canadian Henry Czerny does what he can and is remarkable, but cannot save the movie alone.",
            "What to think about this one...\r\n\r\nI'm not totally sure how I view <em>'Ready or Not'</em>. There are elements to it that I love, things I would've liked to have played differently and one bit that I kinda hated. I'll start with the big positives: Samara Weaving and the visual of Samara Weaving. How epic does Grace look by the end of the movie? So good! Weaving herself gives a brilliant performance, easily the star of the show.\r\n\r\nNow for the parts I'd change, admittedly I haven't thought it through properly so probably wouldn't have made sense, but I digress. Based on the early knockings, I could sense the obvious rift in terms of support that the characters had for 'the event'. I would've loved if we had a civil war-esque situation develop, you could've had basically everything that still happens in the film but Grace, Alex, Daniel and Becky vs. the rest would've been cooler and more eventful imo.\r\n\r\nAs for the bit I disliked: it involves Mark O'Brien's Alex at the end. What an utterly woeful twist, a twist for the sake of twisting. It was quite something how my interest in the movie left me in that exact moment, I don't think a film has lost me that sharply before. So stupid and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a caveat to that. The flick, in fairness, kinda won me back shortly after with the actual conclusion. The 'pops' are amusingly ace, while the final line of Weaving's Grace is a good'un. I just wish that aforementioned issue with Alex didn't happen, because it has altered how I feel about this; albeit, I think, after judging it as an overall, I can still class this 2019 picture as very good."

            "The first compulsion is to reach for an unflattering label when dubbing the third installment of the **Divergent** series as \"the poor man's **Hunger Games**\". Sure, the comparison was inevitable but all the Divergent editions had to do was prove that the unfair comparing and contrasting were wrong. Well, the knockoff status was indeed warranted and unfortunately this copycat YA Sci-Fi serving of a harried heroine and her excitable dystopian dealings never mustered up the kind of distinctive expectations that failed to fuel this flaccid futuristic fable. Hence, **The Divergent Series: Allegiant** is an over-stuffed mechanical continuation of a familiar film franchise trying desperately to fulfill its colorful action-packed whimsy left over by its pumped-up predecessors.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, **Allegiant** is the third episode of the **Divergent** movie series. Of course Veronica Roth is the literary voice responsible for the books on which these films are based. Jokingly, one would probably imagine that both Roth and **Hunger Games** author Suzanne Collins are twin sisters seeing as though their imaginative wells of creativity are similar in style and content. The only difference is that Collins's notable blueprint registered with forceful reception while Roth's wannabe material was like an identical shadow trying to break out in its own shade. \r\n\r\nBasically, **Allegiant** (much like the rest of the YA genre) is a glorified teen soap opera bombarded with awesome ray guns and youthful cynicism aimed at the controlling over-30 Establishment. Distrust and disillusionment is the recurring theme and the penalty for being young, attractive, repressed and rebellious is a cautionary tale for those that want to challenge the sinister Authority. As with **The Hunger Games'** Katniss Everdeen (played by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence) we are subjected to Divergent diva Tris Pryor (Shailine Woodley) as the feminine firecracker ready to spring into action defeating the aging forces threatening their post- apocalyptic presence. Unfortunately for Woodley's Tris she does not possess the explosive brooding or riveting material and eye-opening challenges that Lawrence's Katniss was blessed with from the get-go. At least one common denominator is clear: both bad-ass babes have totally catchy, cool-sounding names, right?\r\n\r\nThe sluggish plotting in **Allegiant** revisits the enclosed post-apocalyptic Chicago where various \"factions\" of young folks are furiously fighting with one another. The tension is percolating big time as the trapped youthful residents are growing increasingly restless. The disenchanted Tris, along with her studly boyfriend Four (Theo James) and group of rebels, decide to break out of their Chicago-bound doldrums and climb the wall to escape their entrapment. Of course this means crossing over some treacherous terrain to reach a more, idyllic surrounding. The destination, as it turns out, is the comfortable haven for the monitoring overlords spying their every step.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Tris and her bunch stumble upon a picturesque civilization headed by leader David (Emmy-winner Jeff Daniels). The surroundings look idyllic but David is very shady because his agenda is to recruit the pure and precious Tris for his genetic experimentation. With Tris as his main guinea pig the devious David can plan on using his experimental agenda on the underprivileged pretty kids back in the walled-off Chicago. The educated guess is that David most likely would extend the same kind of testing treatment for \"the Fringes\" as well (they are the masses that exist outside the wall of Chicago in less flattering pockets of the region). In any event, Tris represents the ideal vision for his replication of purity and perfection to be transferred to the \"damaged\" souls out there. While Tris is intrigued by the CEO's intention for bettering the impoverished population Four is skeptical about David's focus on his gun-toting honey bunny. \r\n\r\nTo say that **The Divergent Series--Allegiant** is clunky and convoluted even for a showy older kiddie caper is an understatement to say the least. Director Robert Schwentke is basically on auto pilot here as the cameras roll while capturing the drawn out degrees of splashy stunts, showdowns and bombastic special effects flourishes. The silly-minded plot and utter familiarity of the \"Big Brother watching over the young perished pretty people\" feels empty and repetitive at its compelling core. One cannot perceive the transparent concept of **Allegiant** going through the motions without looking at this anemic actioner as a convenient means to bridge the upcoming remaining installments to protect its promising box office clout. So for those looking forward to **Ascendant** please hold your horses because this is what **Allegiant** strives for...to make one salivate over the next due edition to this tiring movie series.  \r\n\r\nSure, **The Divergent Series--Allegiant** and perhaps **Ascendant** will offer more of the same and if this is something that its avid fans do not mind then fine...knock yourselves out to your heart's redundant content.\r\n\r\n**The Divergent Series--Allegiant** (2016)\r\n\r\nLionsgate\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 1 min.\r\n\r\nStarring: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Ray Stevenson, Jeff Daniels, Zoe Kravitz and Miles Teller\r\n\r\nDirected by: Robert Schwentke\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Action & Adventure/Fantasy/Romance\r\n\r\nCritic's Rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2016",
            "> Realising what's left behind was the home.\r\n\r\nHere comes the most expected adventure in the 'Divergent' series. I always wondered what lies outside the wall. So this sequel takes us to the new land where a fresh development takes place. A few old characters were terminated in order to introduce a bunch of new ones. As a theme, it just looked like 'The Scorch Trial', but of course totally a different setting. \r\n\r\nThe director was retained from the previous installment and I think he did a good job. The concept was too familiar. 'Scorch Trial', 'Catching Fire', 'Aeon Flux', all these films are just like this one. Thankfully, this story was decent. At least better than the previous and weaker than the first. The pace drastically held back due to the split of a book into two films. It has been done in the old days, but the present trend began after 'Deathly Hallows'.\r\n\r\nI was excited to know how big stretch it is going to be as a story wise. Because it looked like the things they've accomplished in one place and looking to explore beyond the boundary. I couldn't predict the story, but I knew what's going to happen in the end of every scene. The dystopian theme was clich\u00e9d, not the storyline. The way it ended is a sign for a big finale to commence in the final film of the series. Let's hope for 'Ascendant' to end on a high note.\r\n\r\n6/10",
            "Probably my favorite out series. They finally make it past the wall and find a whole new world with advance technicallogy. Just like there world the other civilization has there own evil agendas.",
            "Picking up where \"Insurgent\" left off; \"Tris\" and \"Four\" determine that they must escape the walls of Chicago and make a new life for themselves - regardless of the risks and uncertainty. Once free - perhaps the only few moments of tension in the film - they hook up with a group of ostensibly like-minded rebels; but are they who they say they are? Seeds of suspicion are sewn that test the relationship between Theo & Shailene; and frankly the patience of the viewer. Jeff Daniels tries hard to inject some menace as \"David\" but Miles Teller \"Peter\" is just plain irritating. We are clearly heading for a grand-scale denouement, but where is it? Instead someone decided to leave us with some ambiguity (I suspect a fourth in the franchise may have been, at one stage, on the cards?) The actors are going through the motions as though they, too, can't wait for the conclusion so they can all go home for ice cream. It looks good, they look good, but it isn't much good...",
            "Allegiant takes the Divergent series in a direction that just doesn\u2019t work, despite having the same strong visuals and solid score as the previous films. The plot feels stretched thin, trying too hard to expand the world while failing to give any real weight to the story. There\u2019s an attempt to build tension and introduce new conflicts, but the character depth just isn\u2019t there. Tris, who started as a strong lead, feels sidelined by a weak script, and halfway through, I found myself disconnected from her journey. The pacing is all over the place, with rushed moments that should have been developed and long stretches that drag without real purpose.\r\n\r\nThe directing tries to hold things together, but it feels like the movie is constantly fighting against itself. Key decisions, especially involving Miles Teller\u2019s character, make no sense at all. Shailene Woodley does her best with what she\u2019s given, but the material doesn't support her performance. The rest of the cast ranges from passable to forgettable, with little to no meaningful character growth. Even the chemistry between characters, which was at least somewhat engaging in the previous films, feels forced and lifeless here.\r\n\r\nVisually, the cinematography and effects are decent, but they can\u2019t save the film from its weak storytelling. The score is one of the few redeeming factors, adding some much-needed emotion and tension, but it isn\u2019t enough to carry the film. The biggest issue is the lack of a satisfying climax or resolution. The movie builds toward something, only to fizzle out completely, leaving an empty, frustrating ending. It\u2019s no surprise this installment flopped, considering how little effort seemed to go into improving the story. Instead of elevating the franchise, Allegiant feels like a step backward, making it clear why the final chapter was scrapped."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI love war movies, especially when they're able to depict the action in such an immersive way that the viewers really feel like they're there. In my opinion, it's the genre that most requires a technically outstanding production quality. The visual effects need to be absolutely perfect. The cinematography must capture the intensity of the battlefield. The sound design has to be incredibly powerful. Finally, a war film requires the most epic, nail-biting, chill-inducing score so the audience can actually feel the unbelievable atmosphere that this genre usually possesses. Greyhound has one of the greatest actors of all-time as its protagonist, but does it check the points mentioned above?\r\n\r\nYes and no. Technically, this movie barely has any issues. The VFX look utterly stunning, no doubt about it. Shelly Jackson, the cinematographer, has one of the most challenging tasks a filmmaker can have: filming in a water environment. He deals with this problem surprisingly well, by allowing the viewers to fully understand everything that's going on for the entire runtime. The score (Blake Neely) is emotionally powerful, but I believe it could have elevated a lot more action sequences than it actually does. The editing (Mark Czyzewski, Sidney Wolinsky) is excellent as well.\r\n\r\nSo, what failed? Well, I will always defend that the two pillars of any film are its story and characters. Without one of these two, very few movies can survive. Without the two, no film can. I have to use Dunkirk as an example here. Christopher Nolan spent the whole marketing campaign saying that his movie was about the depiction of an actual war. About how it felt to actually be in one. Therefore, Dunkirk barely has any sort of character development\u2026 because not only it never intended to, but it doesn't need it to accomplish its goal. \r\n\r\nHowever, its storytelling follows a distinct method that allows for some exhilarating moments in the air, ground, and sea. Its action sequences are so powerful and incredibly realistic that I consider it the most immersive war experience I have ever experienced. Thus, the lack of compelling characters didn't really bother me because I was there to try to feel what it's like to be in a war. Greyhound also doesn't have one single character who's well-developed or well-explored. They all seem to have names, and that's it. Tom Hanks is obviously impressive in his acting role\u2026\r\n\r\nBut his skills as a screenwriter definitely need to improve. Like I insinuate above, there's no problem in having depthless characters, as long as the story and, in this case, the action, work. None do. I'm not lying when I write that 90%+ of the script is Hanks yelling \"turn right\", \"hard left\", \"slow down\", and hundreds of other types of direction guidelines in nautical language. The action is lackluster. Basically, the whole film is a repetitive, tiresome cycle of a U-boat showing up on the radar, Hanks looking through several windows shouting the same nautical stuff to his crew, and trying to eliminate the enemy's ships.\r\n\r\nI could feel the suspense and the tension that Hanks' ship emanated. I love the first encounter and pursuit of the first U-boat, it's exceptionally filmed and quite riveting. But from this moment on, it's just the same sequence stuck on repeat mode until no more ships exist. So, even though the set pieces look marvelous, these scenes quickly lose impact. Aaron Schneider should have found a way of elevating Hanks' screenplay, but unfortunately, he can only do so much. By the end, I'm left with a character whose name I can barely remember (honestly, I needed two full minutes to remember the protagonist's name after the movie ended).\r\n\r\nAll in all, Greyhound could have easily ended up as a small-scale Dunkirk. Technically, it has everything it needs to be a brilliant war flick: beautiful visual effects, powerful sound design, impeccable cinematography, and an epic score. Disregarding one of the two pillars of filmmaking (story and characters) is only an issue if the other also doesn't work. The lack of any character development can be perfectly compensated in a war film, as long as the method of storytelling allows for a unique experience packed with realistic and immersive action. However, Aaron Schneider's movie doesn't possess a compelling story, and the action set pieces are stuck in a dull cycle of hunting U-boats in the exact same way throughout the whole film. The first sequence is packed with tension and suspense, but from that moment on, the entertainment levels drop drastically. Tom Hanks is fantastic as the protagonist, but his screenplay is far from truly being one. All dialogues revolve around characters (mostly Hanks's) calling nautical instructions for most of the runtime and looking either through a window or binoculars. In the end, it's underwhelming and disappointing, but I still recommend it to the war genre's aficionados.\r\n\r\nRating: C",
            "Greyhound is watchable but entirely fanciful.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is a Captain of a destroyer taking on the u-boat menace. He's fearless, god fearing, modest and faces down hordes of u-boats who are out to get him. \r\n\r\nThe enemy goads him, sends u-boats to face off with destroyers in 18th century style exchanges and sails around on the surface  following his floatilla, in open defiance. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow for an injection of reality. U-boats did not take on destroyers in surface battles of the kind you see in this film. They did not goad their captains (and records show they took no pleasure in the job they did) nor did they let the destroyer know they were there. This is a fiction and a rather silly one at that. U-boats were not a match for a destroyer, in any sense and made every effort to evade them. \r\n\r\nThe US in the early days of this war, were hopelessly outclassed by u-boat packs. It took considerable time before they started defending merchant shipping. Their admirality mostly declined advice and help from their more experienced, British counterparts. This predictably made  the situation a lot worse. Eventually they did catch up but only after suffering massive losses. \r\n\r\nThis film is, in short, a fiction. Its entertaining, its well acted, I do like Tom Hanks and the action scenes whilst in many instances ridiculous, are well rendered and frenetic. \r\n\r\nSo by all means watch Greyhound for pure entertainment but don't expect a \"Das Boot\" experience by any means. Its worth mentioning too that even Das Boot was not 100% correct but a lot closer to the truth than this film could ever hope to be. \r\n\r\n6/10.",
            "When you hear the words \u201ca Tom Hanks war movie,\u201d there are certain expectations of quality that flash in your head (with good reason). Perhaps that\u2019s why \u201cGreyhound\u201d feels like such a disappointment. This World War II military action film is one of the most boring war movies I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay, written by Hanks and based on the novel \u201cThe Good Shepherd\u201d by C.S. Forester, recounts the fictional story of Captain Krause (Hanks), a veteran Navy officer who is serving as a first-time captain of a U.S. destroyer. Krause is tasked with protecting a convoy of three dozen ships carrying thousands of soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic. Krause and his men must navigate the treacherous waters for five days with no air support, relying only on the aid of two additional escort ships in an area of the ocean dubbed the \u201cBlack Pit.\u201d Things get really bad when the fleet is attacked by Nazi U-boats, and a lengthy battle of ships vs. submarines breaks out.\r\n\r\nThe story is inspired by events that took place during the Battle of the Atlantic in the early days of WWII, but it\u2019s not a true story. If that wasn\u2019t enough of a bummer, the film is mediocre all around. From the dreadful original score (by Blake Neely) to the weak special effects and dreary cinematography, the movie screams \u201clow budget\u201d in more ways than one. It\u2019s not cinematic, and the production values look and feel cheap. The film is poorly directed (by Aaron Schneider), who seems to hold a pathetic understanding of the architecture of visual excitement and suspense. Hence, the wartime action is mediocre and dull, and the entire project is little more than a crudely edited jump cut fiesta.\r\n\r\nHanks has written his character in such a one-dimensional manner that all Captain Krause really does is quote Bible verses and bark military lingo. The film assumes an advanced knowledge of technical military terms, making it all to easy to check out of the experience. It\u2019s also overly religious, to the point that it could easily be a faith-based film.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreyhound\u201d is nothing more than one long, non-exciting battle between a warship and submarines. There are far too many good war movies to spend your time watching than this blunder.",
            "Let this review reflects that I really enjoyed this movie. It seems a lot of war movie fans didn\u2019t, so since I only enjoy the occasional war film, perhaps it makes sense I would like Greyhound.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprisingly short movie at just over 90 minutes. Since I am a writer (though not a successful one), I can imagine the scriptwriter (wait, Tom Hanks!?) wanting to compress the action to help give the film a sense of immediacy, a pacing to match the key moments of battle. But who knows, besides Hanks and a few others? Not all war movies need to be of epic proportion; let\u2019s allow some of them to simply tell a compelling story, if only for non war movie fans such as Myself.\r\n\r\nMost of the acting is restrained, and that makes sense. This was the captain\u2019s first real gig on patrol, so he needed to present a calm, commanding presence no matter how his insides twirled and spun. As for the crew, their lives depended upon staying cool under pressure. I really liked Stephen Graham\u2019s quiet confidence in his crucial role interpreting the sonar. \r\n\r\nI thought there was enough tension to drive the story forward, especially when you consider that the most tense moments are when you don\u2019t see anything - while the U-Boat subs are under water.\r\n\r\nThere has been chatter that this war film is not realistic or accurate in key details, but I wonder about that. I see where the novel by C. S. Forester that the movie is based on was used as a navy training text for many years. So there\u2019s that.\r\n\r\nI plan to watch Greyhound again, as it strikes me as one of those movies that might reveal subtle details with a second viewing. That\u2019s my story and I am sticking to it, as it gives mer a reason to re-watch it.\r\n\r\n*** Note: I just watched it a second time, and I stand by my positive review. I caught a few details I missed the first time by having the captions turned on. ***",
            "I never thought I'd see Tom Hanks starring in a feature film with the same production values as a SyFy Channel original movie, but here is Greyhound \u2013 an otherwise tight, lean, and straightforward picture. \r\n\r\nDirector Aaron Schneider and Hanks, who also wrote the script, do a good job developing suspense and urgency; for example the opening sequence wherein the crew of the Fletcher-class destroyer Greyhound patiently stalks and intercepts a German submarine before eventually blowing it up with depth charges, or when, after the hunter becomes the hunted and the American destroyer comes under heavy fire, the captain of the Greywolf \u2013 another, much more fearsome, German submarine \u2013 radios the Greyhound to taunt the crew with omens of doom; other than this disembodied voice we hear or see no Nazis, and the Greywolf, like Moby Dick, appears only until the very end, all of which adds to the sense of constant, ever-present danger.\r\n\r\nGreyhound is best when decisions are made and orders are given on the ship\u2019s bridge. Unfortunately the thrill of the hunt loses its impact when we peek outside and see that the Greyhound is surrounded by a completely computer-generated sea \u2013 as if it's sailing through an ocean of half-congealed grape jelly. Say what you will about Waterworld, but at least it was honest; I don't care if they used a real body of water or just dug a giant pit and filled it one bucket at a time \u2013 the point is, it was honest-to-goodness H2O. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Greyhound's Atlantic Ocean and everything in it \u2013 ships, submarines, explosions \u2013 achieves a level of fakery that not even Hanks's considerable gravitas can overcome. As far as I'm concerned, he's just playing a real-time strategy video game, to the point that when someone died I didn't care; I would just tell myself, \u201cit\u2019s okay, it was just another non-playable character.\u201d"

As an elite member of his craft, he is well paid and lives a very good life keeping high-profile targets safe the world over. When things unexpectedly take a turn we find Michael two years on having hit the skids and struggling to claw his way back to prominence in the new film \u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard\u201d.\r\nThings become complicated for Michael as a despotic tyrant named Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is on trial for war crimes and countless atrocities, and is about to go free due to removing all those who would be able to testify against him with credible evidence.\u00a0 That is with the exception of one Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson).\u00a0 Darius is incarcerated but makes a deal to testify in exchange for his wife (Selma Hayek), being granted freedom.\u00a0 Darius knows he is a marked man but takes the chance and under the watch of Interpol Agent Roussel (Elodie Yung), they set off.\r\nNaturally things do not go as planned and the two find themselves fleeing for their lives with numerous deadly assassins hot on their heels.\u00a0 Unsure who she can trust, Roussel calls in Michael even though they have some seriously unresolved issues about one another that destroyed their previous relationship. Further complicating matters is the history Michael and Darius share which makes them naturally hostile to one another.\r\nNevertheless, Michael and Darius set off to reach the courtroom but the imposed deadline and face numerous dangers and hilarious situations along the way.\r\nJackson and Reynolds work very well with one another and their banter and chiding comes across as very natural.\u00a0 The jokes come more often than I expected but the film is very much an action film, and the sequences are intense, funny, and gripping, especially and extended chase and fight sequence along the canals and shopping district of Amsterdam.\r\nWhile some may say that the film is just a variation on the Buddy Cop genre of old, the strong cast and the winning mix of jokes and action make the film a very pleasant surprise and one of my more enjoyable films of 2017. It was a highly-enjoyable thrill ride and one of the best films this summer.\r\nIf you are a fan of action, comedies, and the pairing of Jackson and Reynolds, do not miss this film.\r\n4 stars out of 5.",
            "_The Hitman's Bodyguard_ is getting absolutely flensed by the critics, including several of whom I personally value the opinion of very highly. But when it comes to _The Hitman's Bodyguard_, I gotta flat out disagree. It's not out here changing lives for the better, and it's hardly gonna ride out the year on a palanquin of Oscar nominations, but I had a seriously enjoyable time with The Hitman's Bodyguard. Jackson and Reynolds worked. The leads and their respective romantic entanglements worked. Most of all, director Patrick Hughes worked his ass of to blend comedy, action and romance and have it pay off. This isn't Hughes' best work though, if you want to see that, check out 2010's _Red Hill_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "**Once upon a time two sworn enemies teamed up!**\r\n\r\nMaybe the critics are right, but like usual, I don't have to agree with them. This is a nice film, not a great film as a few people lauding. It is entertaining. All the stunts were good, comedies were good enough, but the basic plot itself a cliche. Yes, anybody aged 20+ would surely have seen many similar storied films. It's just in another time with another cast and crew. They had promoted it so well. So the result was incredible. But in reality JUST one time watchable film with not expecting serious laughs.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it could be this year's 'The Nice Guys', and they are about to repeat the same magic of Crowe and Gosling duo. But it was different. Too hard hitting, just what Tarantino fans would like to have. Besides, their guy, Samuel L. Jackson is here. Both the leads were good. That does not mean they have saved the film. That's an assumption of fanboys. Luck could be another factor!\r\n\r\nIt was about a hitman in capture decides to give an important testimony in the International Criminal Court against a powerful man. So now the bad guys are after him in his every move from England to Holland. A demoted bodyguard takes the job to safely get him to his destination. Their journey begins where they are going to encounter a series of obstacles and they finally make it where a major twist comes in before the end.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this is no special, except the way they have presented on the screen makes the difference. But again, not all films are lucky in that criteria as this one. It is like one in a 20-25 films. So if your objective is timepass, then this will do just fine. There could be a sequel, probably prequel seems a nice idea. But I'm not sure whether I want it or not. I'll just be happy if they do!\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

            "A complete waste of opportunity.  The film smacks of studio interference and bad decisions.  It starts off decent enough but at the halfway point it turns into a shambles and it does feel as if a lot of it ended up on the cutting room floor.  The music was very intrusive and some scenes were so badly lit you had no idea who was just killed or even what killed them.\r\n\r\nSome knowing nods to the earlier Predator films was a nice touch and it was good they didn't skimp on the gore and violence but all in all it's a bad movie.  Stick to Predator and Predators.",
            "My mind was racing as I watched _The Predator_ in the cinema tonight. I'd heard virtually nothing good about it so my anxious brain kicked into overdrive the whole time the film was going on. As a result of that, I almost feel like I experienced three movies in that theatre. First, obviously the movie on the screen. Secondly, the awesome movie I was theorising could unfurl at the result of each new sequence and plot point, but that sadly never did. And thirdly, the inexcusably awful and franchise-ruining movie that I feared it was about to take a hard left turn into at any minute, and thankfully never did.\r\n\r\nAnd that's really my experience on _The Predator_ overall, and the reason for a stalemate \"2.5 outta 5\" review: It wasn't as good as it should have been, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Unfortunately, when the movie I'm writing in my head alongside watching it is better than what's actually on screen, when you take into account that I'm an unimaginative, talentless hack, really doesn't cut it for a sequel to _Predator_, one of of only five movies I've ever given a perfect rating to.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of _The Predator_ are when there is an eponymous Predator on screen. So you might think, \"Oh it's not a good movie, but it's a good _Predator_ movie\", and fair enough a conclusion to draw, but no. Part of the problem is, this movie really could have been pulled off with any aliens at all. Take out the Yautja and replace them with... I dunno, the blue skinned pogo-stick people of Planet Hurfadump, and it can still play out functionally the same. See, although I enjoyed watching the Predators do their thing, there was really nothing beyond cosmetic similarities that made them the Predators we've seen in every movie preceding this one.\r\n\r\nI think possibly part of the reason for that is that every other movie with a Predator in it has been an Action Horror movie (albeit Action Horror with ever-increasing Sci-Fi elements from film to film) whereas _The Predator_ is an Action Comedy, just one with some gore. Now I don't think that taking it that route was necessarily and... abysmal failure, let's say, but was Action Comedy the **best** way to take the _Predator_ franchise? I think it's pretty clear that the answer is no.\r\n\r\nIronic that that direction is being taken by Shane Black, the man who has a history with _Predator_ purely because the crew of the first film were determined to have him to work on the script, which he refused. Now here we are more 30 years later and Shane Black finally **has** put his name on a Predator movie, and it's not even good.\r\n\r\nFuck. At least it's better than _AvP: Requiem_!",
            "I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was inclined to step out of the theater to check if I was sitting in the right room. But there it was, definitely a Predator, but obviously totally misplaced in a ridiculous movie - ridiculous story, ridiculous characters, ridiculous acting, ridiculous everything.\r\n\r\nI was so upset. One of the diamonds of a movie genre thrown in the dirt and made fun of. If you want to see how that's done, watch this one.\r\n\r\nA total waste of money - on production side and on cinema visitor's side.",
            "Its just not good.  The first predator created atmosphere; you were being hunted.  The only \"Predator\" film to deliver another dose of this was Predators.  \r\nThis film falls completely short of its predecessors (yes, all of them), but does leave you with a strong impression that this was a cash grab to squeeze any life out of a franchise that surpassed its EOL a long time ago.",
            "OK, I have to disagree with the other reviewers, to date, of this movie.  I totally enjoyed this movie and gave it an 8.  Once you figured it out, I thought the story line made complete sense.  I loved all the new characters, and thought the camaraderie of the main military characters was great and rather realistic.  I don't know about the other reviewers, but I did serve in the U. S. Army and found the character interplay highly realistic.  I am disappointed with the interplay between the \"good guys\" and our government; however, these days you come to expect that.  I don't believe that part would be realistic, but I don't think it distracted that much from the movie, and everyone came together in the end...to, of course, save humanity!  Which, of course, it did otherwise we all wouldn't be here anymore...right?  Good movie!  Go see it and then decide for yourself, but I thought it was definitely worth seeing, so much so I even bought the blu-ray!",
            "A crushing disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?\r\n\r\nPlot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on Earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. The fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.\r\n\r\nWe have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in Predator 87 and Predators 2010. A group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. The subsequent science aspects such as human DNA inference/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. When you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet Predator dog, really?). There's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (PTSD/our hero's family strife et al), and the Predators loose on Earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land. \r\n\r\nPlus points? Well the cinematography is superb (Larry Fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). The score is the traditional one we had from Alan Silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet Henry Jackman gets the credit. Of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (I would be lying if I said a Whoopi Goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these Predators are no longer scary creatures. This reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell. Shame. 3.5/10",
            "**\"Long story short\"**\r\n\r\nUnlike the clueless reviewer (on a different website) who I quoted in the headline, I will not proceed to write 5 paragraphs of meaningless drivel about a movie I hate.\r\n\r\nUsually all of the AvP movies, Alien, Predator and the cross overs are at least a solid 3.5 stars. Of course the original Alien trilogy as well as Predator 1, 2 and even Predators stand out as being very original. The difference between the originals and the spin-offs is clearly the tone they set. In this movie we get a comic book style presented, with by no means bad CGI (dogs looked more real than in Predators for example), a secret research conspiracy, and charismatic heroes getting slaughtered (or not, no spoilers). Just like in the graphic novels, the pace is neck breaking. The ending felt almost rushed, to introduce the new Predator Killer Weapon. It is understandable how regular movie goers are put off by the constant over-stimulation, but I would not want it any other way. The action is over the top, definitely. But there was great attention to detail how the action scenes played out exactly, as opposed to lesser action films in which a flurry of cuts leaves a thinking audience just confused about what just happened.\r\n\r\nSure, I would have loved a darker vibe throughout the film too, especially in the beginning the score reminded a little of a Disney orchestra playing. But \"The Predator\" was a hell of a ride and deserves a special place among the spin-offs.\r\n\r\n28 November 2018\r\n\r\nI am migrating my reviews from a different site which has become simply garbage. TMDB looks awesome and I look forward to be a part of it.",
            "Full disclosure, I've only really seen the first two movies, and after that I ignored the franchise. When the 2010 film dropped, it didn't even hit my radar and none of the crossovers with aliens I even bothered with...\r\n\r\n...but by 2010 I was 30 and, honestly, these are rated \"R\" movies that I loved in my childhood. But that was the 80s when parents could take their children to bloody rated R movies and not be arrested for abuse.\r\n\r\nSo, when they started making more, as much as I loved the first one, I really didn't care too much about the series. They lost me at the sequel.\r\n\r\nBut 2018 rolled around and I was feeling nostalgic. I wanted a throw back to a simpler time when people weren't so high strung about everything including the movies. Why not give it a try.\r\n\r\nAnd, I loved Predator as a kid even though it was clearly an adult movie. But you get the feeling that this one was a rated R movie clearly made for children.\r\n\r\nI remember moments of levity in the first few...but I don't recall them being light and, almost whimsical at all. They were serious sci-fi horror films.\r\n\r\nThis comes across as a Marvel movie, and though I love Marvel movies I don't want a Predator movie to feel like The Avengers. It's the Predator, it is supposed to have a different tone.\r\n\r\nIt left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It was too light to be a Predator movie. It wasn't dark. It wasn't scary, and it had too much of an attempt at humor to enjoy.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the movie stank. It couldn't even remember what it was supposed to be.",
            "Boyd Holbrook - a sort of love child of Mel Gibson and Michael Biehn - is the army sniper hero (\"McKenna\") who finds himself on the wrong end of the law after he and his team encounter the eponymous killing machine in the forest. Lucky to escape with his life, and a few souvenirs from the wreckage, he makes his way to a cantina where he posts his trophies to his wife and son before being taken into custody. Out in space, another of these would be visitors decides it needs to get that stuff back and so arrives duly determined to annihilate all who get in it's way. It turns out that the young \"Rory McKenna\" (Jacob Tremblay) is little short of a genius with AI - and pretty soon he, dad and feisty biologist \"Brackett\" (Olivia Munn) - along with a ragtag band of gung-ho prisoner/soldiers are facing up to their looming terror. Can they survive? Should they survive is probably the better question. Aside from a few scenes at the start and an admittedly lively fifteen minutes at the end, this is almost entirely devoid of the beastie we switched on to see. The dialogue is poorly written, expletive-ridden and banal; the characterisations are really shallow and there are far too many irrelevant sub-plots to distract from the (limited) focus of this 110 minute ramble of a film. The old adage - \"if it ain't broke...\" comes to mind. This is as far removed from the excellent 1987 introduction to this monstrous creature as it's possible to get and is, quite simply, a waste of video tape. There are plenty of adequate visual effects and pyrotechnics, but this film definitely had me rooting for the creature in the mask pretty much from the start!",
            "This movie is **definitely** not in touch with the other entries in the Predator series. The pacing is very fast. There is a lot of comedy and corny acting. The CGI is good at least. \r\n\r\nHonestly painful to watch. I think the target radiance was kids? If not for the gore and the 3 swear words."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI couldn't catch The Call of the Wild when it premiered. Therefore, I didn't remember a single thing about it when I went to watch it yesterday at an empty screening (yei). Once again, I stayed away from trailers, but a few images popped up at the time. The CGI dog didn't look good at all. With reviews coming out and weeks passing by, I couldn't avoid concluding that most of the negative opinions are due to the \"distracting animation\". Knowing that the visuals would probably be disappointing compared with the story, I still watched it with moderate expectations.\r\n\r\nI'm genuinely surprised by so much negative feedback. I really enjoyed it, and it's one of my favorite films of the year, so far. Yes, it doesn't mean much, having in mind it's only March, and it will very likely not even receive an honorable mention by the year's end. Nevertheless, the supposedly distracting CGI dog (Buck) didn't bother me in the slightest. Buck might not be a perfect animated animal, but as long as people go in with the right mindset, the chances of enjoying the story are much higher.\r\n\r\nIt's an animated dog. Accept it, move on, and everything will flow a lot easier. I believe it belongs in that \"uncanny valley\" category. Something weird might work well for some people, and horribly for the rest. I didn't mind it at all, and I go as far as saying that a few moments are elevated exclusively due to the dog's expressions. I also defend that this movie needed the CGI dog instead of a real one. It's not an ordinary dog: Buck is stronger, bigger, taller, and he has a special wild instinct that home dogs lack.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: Buck isn't visually perfect. Sure, there are a few scenes where the CGI becomes too overwhelming and awkward. However, it doesn't detract from the heartfelt narrative. Buck is undoubtedly the main character. He has emotional conflicts, personal motivations, a distinct personality that changes along with his adventures, and a part of him that he needs to explore. The first half of the film is packed with action, fun, and a clear purpose. It's extremely captivating and entertaining, even if it follows the usual, predictable storylines. Good performances from Omar Sy (Perrault) and Cara Gee (Fran\u00e7oise) during this portion.\r\n\r\nThe second half is when Harrison Ford's character (John Thornton) finally comes in (he scarcely shows up until then). From now until the end, the movie employs a slower pace, focusing on Ford's reflection about his life, and Buck's journey to find the place where he ultimately belongs. Harrison Ford delivers such a subtle, emotional performance. I can't remember the last time I saw Ford so committed to a role. John possesses a devastating, tragic past, and Buck is able to bring some joy and fulfillment into his life. For a dog lover like myself, it's such a tear-inducing, genuine, heartwarming story.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect I truly dislike is, unfortunately, Dan Stevens's character (Hal). He's just an incredibly cliche, despicable \"villain\", who doesn't fit with the rest of the film. I love the actor, but his over-the-top display doesn't always work, and Hal suffers a lot from his exaggerated manners and expressions. In my opinion, he could have been completely removed from the movie, and it would have been a lot better. Totally unnecessary, and lazily written subplot, to be honest. Oh, and Karen Gillan (Mercedes)? I literally just discovered she was in the film as well...\r\n\r\nThe Call of the Wild is one of those movies that suffer from bad trailers. People either skip it or go in with a pre-defined negative mindset. It proves that the best (and only) way to judge a film is to simply watch it. CGI Buck isn't an animated work of art, sure, but he's far from being distracting or annoying. To be honest, I feel that he elevates a lot of emotional moments. Buck is exceptionally well-written, standing out as a complex and emotionally compelling protagonist. I laughed, I cried, and I felt entertained by all of his crazy adventures. Harrison Ford delivers his best performance of the last couple of years in a slower-paced second half of the movie, after a frenetic, action-heavy first half. Dan Stevens' character is definitely the worst aspect of the story. An unnecessary, cliche, horrible \"villain\" with no place in the narrative. All in all, I highly recommend giving this film a chance! Avoid its trailers, accept the fact that Buck is, indeed, an animated dog, and try to enjoy the genuinely heartfelt story at its core.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

            "W.C. Fields said you should never work with children or animals. Thanks to CGI technology, you don\u2019t have to anymore \u2013 at least not with animals. Buck, the main dog in The Call of the Wild, appears to be a cross between Beethoven and Roger Rabbit. Like the former, Buck destroys or eats everything in his path, and like the latter, it\u2019s painfully clear that the human actors are interacting with an animated character \u2013 the difference being that Roger Rabbit is actually supposed to be a cartoon.\r\n\r\nBuck\u2019s not alone, though. In the Yukon, he and a husky have a fight that plays like the doggy version of 300. The advantage of using computer generated animals \u2013 not only the dogs but also wolves, rabbits, etc. \u2013 is that you don't have to worry about ASPCA or PETA. The downside, however, is that the audience doesn't worry either about what happens to these creatures, because it\u2019s blatantly obvious that they're not real; moreover, not only are they not there, but there isn\u2019t even a \u2018there\u2019 for them to be, since the entire world around them \u2013 snow, trees, rivers, even the horizon \u2013 is equally fake-looking. This should have been a fully animated movie; it still would have looked awful, being computer-animated, but at least it would have been consistent.\r\n\r\nBuck\u2019s problem, of course, goes beyond appearances; on top of not looking like an actual dog, he doesn\u2019t act like one either. For example, he takes Harrison Ford\u2019s whiskey bottle away from him and refuses to give it back \u2013 pray tell, how exactly does Buck know that drinking\u2019s bad for ya? In general, Buck is as good a judge of character as dogs usually are in the movies \u2013 and only in the movies; if that were also the case in real life, Hitler and Blondi would not have been as happy together as they indeed were.\r\n\r\nIf a dog looks like a dog, behaves like a dog, and is in fact a dog to whom things happen that would realistically happen to a dog, we can\u2019t help but care about him the same way we care about Bresson\u2019s donkey in Au Hasard Balthazar. You don\u2019t have to actually put the animal in harm\u2019s way \u2013 that\u2019s why they invented animatronics, after all \u2013; just make sure we can believe that there\u2019s something tangible at stake, and suspension of disbelief will do the rest."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWith all due respect to Roland Emmerich and to his fantastic Independence Day, his movies never quite reach their potential, ending up in constant disappointments. It doesn't matter if he has excellent casts or amazing VFX teams, his films' screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues. Midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns. Without knowing the director, anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated. From the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals, it has two attention-grabber ingredients, which can result in a remarkable film\u2026 only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough: story and characters.\r\n\r\nThese are the main issue with Emmerich's movies. His characters are not compelling or intriguing enough, and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement (whether these are written by him or someone else). When I noticed that Midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the Battle of Midway, I immediately got excited. War epics are a genre that I sincerely appreciate. However, when I checked who was \"running the show\", I instantly lowered my expectations. Honestly, it's exactly what I expected it to be: visually gripping, but emotionally hollow.\r\n\r\nI don't want to understate it. The CGI work in this film is jaw-dropping. The actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design. Even at a regular screening with the usual 7.1 Dolby surround speakers, the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes. This is why I think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie. Maybe not a vast majority, but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment. It has a long runtime, and it's hard to get through the exposition-heavy story, but in the end, I bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's still a very superficial flick. While it's very respectful to everyone who fought in the war (including the Japanese) and to the historic event on itself, it lacks emotional attachment to its characters. Dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world, but its main criticism connects to what I just wrote. Christopher Nolan's film also didn't have any compelling characters. However, there's a big difference between these two movies. Both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct. Dunkirk was all about showing the actual war. It never marketed itself as a character-study or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there. Nolan repeated several times: it's about the war and the war only.\r\n\r\nIt's genuinely one of the best, if not the best, *pure* war film I've ever seen. When it comes to depicting the claustrophobic, unbreathable, restless, bloody, loud event that a devastating war is, Dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair (at least, I did in IMAX). On the other hand, Midway's marketing was about paying homage to \"people who fought in the Battle of Midway\". Hence the stellar cast compared to Nolan's just competent actors (with obvious exceptions like Mark Rylance or Tom Hardy). It spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle, not with the action itself. Therefore, these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs.\r\n\r\nWes Tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic. Characters discuss specific topics that don't make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place. Throughout the runtime, there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story, which ends up turning the narrative confusing, convoluted, and lacking faster pacing. It's tough to get through the non-action periods, and I can't even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast. Ed Skrein remarkably portrays Dick Best, the only character who's genuinely compelling and carries a complete, well-developed arc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't feel invested in any other character. Only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role. Midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell. In addition to this, it has to stretch its runtime because you can't get Woody Harrelson or Dennis Quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines. As time goes by, Emmerich's storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow. It's yet another film added to the \"wasted potential\" list\u2026\r\n\r\nPotential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be. It's undeniable that these are entertaining, gripping, and exciting. The dive bombers' scenes are packed with so much tension that I was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target, and a bomb went into the sea. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary. Midway's war is as close to epic as it could be, but as with every other cinematic production, if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action, there are no outstanding VFX that can save a lousy screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the Battle of Midway, but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters. With more characters that what it needed, the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didn't have more than a couple of lines. Roland Emmerich has to thank his VFX team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle. Truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences, plus a powerful sound design, get your teeth biting the nails. Unfortunately, except for Ed Skrein's character, I didn't feel invested enough to appreciate the non-action moments due to the confusing, convoluted, and exposition-heavy narrative. It's a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story. However, I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and \"based on a true story\" adaptations.\r\n\r\nPS: it doesn\u2019t hurt to research a bit about the Battle of Midway. I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m sort of regretting that now. Don\u2019t make the same mistake.

Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, \tevents lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4\u20137, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William \"Bull\" Halsey. \r\n\r\n\"Midway\" (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d (2001). While I loved \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d and proudly stand by it, \u201cMidway\u201d chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there\u2019s a tribute to each at the close.  \r\n\r\nThis is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii. The flick successfully takes the viewer right into the midst of the fight on the water, in the air and under the water. It\u2019s exciting, horrific and revelatory.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs almost 2 hours and 18 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",
            "War stories are only worth retelling in film if you're doing something new and interesting with the genre. Otherwise, it's just a retread of 'Pearl Harbour' or 'Fury' or any of the dozen other thematically-empty, explosion-happy extravaganzas from the last ten years. There's a compelling, nuanced, and affecting film to be made about Midway. This is not that film.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-midway-sound-and-fury-signifying-nothing",
            "Admittedly I have a love for anything involving World War II and although the dialogue was a bit spotty and some of the visual effects were okay at best, I still found this to be a pretty good war movie and nice performances all around. Probably doesn't rank all that high compared to others about Midway and Pearl Harbor, yet still found it to be worth checking out. **3.75/5**",
            "Click here for a video version of this review: youtu.be/2Mr6XRF4GR4\r\n\r\n_Midway_ is an ambitous film that sets out to follow the United States entry into World War Two, from the attack on Pearl Harbour through to the Battle of Midway. To tell this story it focuses on two main characters who are also based on real life people. There's Ed Skrein playing Dick Best, a pilot on the USS Enterprise, and Patrick Wilson playing intelligence officer Edwin Layton.\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine jamming seven months of war into just over two hours is a big task, and while they did manage to pull this off, the result is a movie that feels rushed, where we can't get to know all the many characters, and which probably requires a pretty strong knowledge of this time period in history to understand all the things that are rapidly being thrown on screen.\r\n\r\nI actually had a lot of trouble telling who was who in many of the scenes involving the pilots. Apart from Ed Skrein and Luke Evans the rest of the pilots and rear gunners are such a copy / paste of each other and they come and go so fast on screen that you have zero time to have any kind of emotional connection to them, even though the movie tries to make you feel for them. For a lead actor, Skrein is very wooden and uninspiring, and I don't think has shoulders big enough to carry his part of the film.\r\n\r\nThen, as if the 10,000 mile an hour story is not bad enough, this movie relies very heavily on visual effects. Apart from close-ups, everything you see that involves a ship or a plane is entirely CGI and it is woefully bad 99% of the time. I've used the Playstation analogy a lot, and this is another example. I feel like if they had cut back the story to not cover so many fights and battles, there would have been a lot less visual effect shots. And with less shots to create and render, perhaps those remaining would have come out looking more realistic. As it is, it really takes you out of the movie - the planes move like they are weightless and defy the laws of physics, the explosions look they were made in AfterEffects, and each scene on a ship has that horrible green screen glow about it.\r\n\r\nIn summary I think this movie suffers from trying to do too much all at once. This came off feeling more like a trilogy of movies about Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid, and The Battle of Midway had been edited down to one single movie. The end result is a rushed film that is hard to follow, whose characters are difficult to connect with, and whose visual effects are video game level at best. This will not go down in history as a great war film.",
            "This movie was a bit of a positive surprise. I was actually prepared to not like it that much but Hollywood actually made a decent war movie without pushing their usual left wing political propaganda and woke SJW bullshit.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s really a good movie in pretty much all aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst, I liked that it covers quite a bit more than \u201cjust\u201d Midway. It actually starts before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Then it covers the attack on Perl Harbor and also the famous Dolittle raid on Tokay to finally end up with the battle of Midway. All of it is more or less historically accurate. We also get to see a fair amount of the history from the viewpoint of the Japanese. Whether that bit of the story is actually entirely accurate I guess no one will ever know of course.\r\n\r\nI also liked that they took the effort to get all Japanese actors (or Japanese looking at least) playing the Japanese side and that they spoke Japanese all the time. That\u2019s the kind of thing that gives the right atmosphere for those parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe acting was overall good on both sides. I quite liked Woody Harrelson as Nimitz. Ed Skrein was probably the actor I felt made the most mediocre performance but that might just be me.\r\n\r\nOf course there can be no war movie without things going boom and this movie didn\u2019t disappoint on that. It has plenty of action, lots of flight scenes and lots of thing being blown up and it was overall well made. The effects when large ships got torpedoed, bombed or when their munitions exploded was quite realistic. You could see the ships shuddering and the effect on the water around it.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something it was that the movie is too short. Given the large time period it covers there is so much material that it could easily have been longer. It almost felt a bit rushed. There could have been much more suspense around the battle of Midway itself and the part of how they got Yorktown operational, and hid the fact from the Japanese, in time for the battle was altogether left out for example.\r\n\r\nThe movie was 2 hours 18 minutes long which is respectable but not that long by today\u2019s standards. All three of the extended Lord of the Rings movies was three and a half hours long and this one could easily have been as long.",
            "I am not a fan of war movies (and therefore not an authoritative reviewer) so I can only say that I thought it was fairly entertaining. Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quaid were as good as I would expect them to be and the large cast certainly held their own.\r\n\r\nI felt there were some war movie cliches here and there, but the Japanese were portrayed with respect and, I assume, realism. The battle felt like a very near thing to me, like it could easily have gone the other way with a bit less bravery and persistence on the part of the American fliers. Plus it showed only two planes returning in the end, but someone said they lost half their men. Perhaps the rest landed on different carriers and was just unclear. But as I said, I knew little of the details of the battle going in."

            "I will be short. You should understand how hard to make movies based on such a legendary universe (expectation is too high!), with a lot of characters that need screen time, and with limited budget, PLUS in a pandemic situation, - the director made a great job.\r\n\r\nThis is the best adaptation of such a legendary title.",
            "Mortal Kombat Gives Fans Of The Franchise The Brutal Live-Action Version They Deserve\r\nFans of the Mortal Kombat series have known that the path to bringing the violent and controversial game to live-action formats has been a mixed bag. While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.\r\n\r\nAn animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.\r\n\r\nThe latest offering in the series \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.\r\n\r\nRaiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth. Naturally, this is not going to be easy as Shang Tsung (Chin Han); is not willing to follow the rules of the tournament and dispatches his top fighter (Sub Zero (Joe Taslim) to dispatch the champions of Earth before the tournament in a clear violation of the rules in order to ensure total victory.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is solid and very graphic action which contains gore and brutality on a level that almost kept the film from earning an R-rating. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhile the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film. That being said; \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d gives fans a solid adaptation that does not shy away from gore and violence and gives fans the cinematic experience that they have wanted.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEven though I consider myself somewhat of a gamer, I was never the biggest fan of the Mortal Kombat games, probably because I never really knew how to play them. Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.\r\n\r\nThe only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the \"Fatality!\" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled \"YEAH!\".\r\n\r\nI admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From \"Flawless Victory!\" to \"Fatality!\", without forgetting the classic \"Fight!\", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click \"play\" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
            "I liked this more than I should have.  \r\n\r\nI have tried the games, but am not into the fighting genre of games (although the Injustice series grabbed me for its story).  The previous movies were fun and didnt take themselves seriously - which was good, but they got too hammy and over the top.  The last cartoon took itself way to seriously and was disappointing and forgettable to say the least.  \r\n\r\nThis movie, however seemed to grab everything good from the previous attempts, added actors who know some martial arts, used some of the key terms and moves from the games and had a stand out performance from Josh Lawson as Kano adding the 'very dry type of  Australian' humour.  Hell, the score was even good.  \r\n \r\nGiven that this is pretty much the same as the game - 10-12 fights some spectacular fatalities and a basic plot with no character development - this was a very fun way to spend 2 hours.",
            "Fluff entertainment at its most bland. The fighting is pretty forgettable but at least they utilized the R rating for some decent gore that honors the game at least. Acting is at best so-so while the dialogue was pretty bad and it probably 10-15 minutes too long. Can't say I'll remember this but for what it is, it's fine as a time-waster. **2.75/5**",
            "Okay so let's start by saying I wasn't exactly sure what to think going into this movie I didn't know what was going to happen but wow this is one of the best action films of the decade so far yeah it started slow but really was a good full time of excitement",
            "OK LETS start off with if you have not watched the latest animations of mortal kombat this will movie will make you feel abit effy. You will need more background on the actual characters you know from previous movies and those you don't. and the True scorpion and sub zero animation also covers alot. Good fighting movie though. Shouting GET OVER HERE!!!!!!and FINISH HIM haha it makes a person feel like you part of it.",
            "I've played Mortal Kombat since it first came out. I watched the original movies in the theaters. I had high hopes that maybe a reboot would make it feel fresh and maybe establish it as a darker genre like the games are.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace in this film is the Scorpion and Sub-Zero Feud. I felt disconnected from Raiden and Shang Tsung because they were so emotionless and hollow. I did like who they got to play Kabal because I felt like that character was really well-written. I usually don't like Sonya Blade but this movie made me like her. I don't like Liu Kang I never will so it didn't much matter who they cast in that role because that character to me is too generic. I did not care one way or another for Kung Lao or Kano. The guy playing Jax has been the best Jax so far. I hate how they made Milenna look in this one and it just didn't suit the purpose of what her character really is. Goro felt copied and pasted from the original film.\r\n\r\nAll in all this could have been much better but I doubt we get to see anything past this due to how generic and unfeeling this film actually felt. Sad excuse for a Mortal Kombat reboot.",
            "Mortal Kombat is not just too long for a movie based on a fighting video game; it\u2019s actually too dumb to even be a movie based on a fighting video game. On the one hand it does a Resident Evil, introducing a new character and making him the hero, instead of giving this role to an already established character \u2013 preferably one that is, you know, popular among the franchise\u2019s fan base.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand, it dips into the same old MK well, kicking off with the Hanzo Hasashi Family Massacre \u2013 Kombat\u2019s equivalent of the biblical Massacre of the Innocents. Only last year the animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge covered the exact same ground, and did it a lot better. The intertitle that follows the prologue confirms that we are not about to see anything new (Earthrealm blahblahblah Tournament blahblahblah Outworld blahblahblah).\r\n\r\nMK21 contains exactly (sub)zero surprises. The first time we see Jax, we know he is going to lose his original arms and have them replaced with cybernetic prosthetics (the only surprising thing about this is that the character's first replacement arms are quite underwhelming. Jax eventually gets something more in line with what we\u2019re used to; the question is, why does the movie do in three steps what it should do in two?). Similarly, Kano's true, treacherous nature is no secret.\r\n\r\nWe already know all this. We know it like the backs of our hands. If we don't know it from playing the game, we know it from watching the 1995 movie \u2013 speaking of which, MK95 is 10 minutes shorter (it wasted little time with pre-Tournament antics, and it didn\u2019t even bother with a Training Montage; in contrast, MK21 includes what is best described as a tutorial, not the way you want to go about evoking a video game feel), which is to say 10 minutes better. It also had better effects; its Goro was clumsy and awkward \u2013 something like the Cryptkeeper on stereoids \u2013 but when Johnny Cage punched him in the balls, I felt it. Conversely, when Cole (Lewis Tan), the aforementioned brand-new character, fights Goro in MK21, it\u2019s like he\u2019s shadowboxing, and his shadow happens to be a four-armed man-mountain of pixels.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, what\u2019s the point of watching a movie where we can anticipate every important event, and anything we don\u2019t see coming a mile away turns out to be unnecessary? For example, it's cool \u2013 pun intended \u2013 when Sub-Zero makes it hail, but that\u2019s just a gimmick \u2013 nothing more than smoke and mirrors.",

So this should really be her review... because I'm just going to trash it.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is plot, as in they actually tried to add in a real plot. Mortal Kombat is a fighting game.

It thought it had to be something more than it a tournament. It thought the characters had to have more than surface level depth.\r\n\r\nTHE DIDN'T.\r\n\r\nThe Tournament should have been the star. The plot should have only been there to move you from fight to fight with a climax that shouted \"FATALITY!\" and left it at that.\r\n\r\nInstead they tried to add depth where no depth was needed... and that killed the fun of Mortal Kombat.\r\n\r\nNot every movie needs to have a plot and characters, some movies work best as mindless popcorn munching escapism.",

But I also enjoyed it and hope the sequel does happen someday soon.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><b>Pros:</b>\r\n* The character roster was pretty big for a first outing, and I appreciated seeing so many of my favorites right off the bat.\r\n* The costuming and aesthetics were stunning. I immediately recognized each character because their designs held true to the games while still being updated and modernized. The attention to detail was incredible.\r\n* Josh Lawson surprised, making Kano undoubtedly the most entertaining part of this movie.\r\n* Casting some true martial artists like Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada gave the action more skill and grit.\r\n* The R rating was the right fit for Mortal Kombat, allowing the gore-filled fatalities fans have come to love in the games.\r\n\r\n</blockquote><blockquote><b>Cons:</b>\r\n* With a massive payer of characters to choose from in the Mortal Kombat universe, the addition of Lewis Tan\u2019s Cole Young was unnecessary and annoying. A dozen existing characters could have served as the audience\u2019s perspective.\r\n* Adapting a fantastical and violent video game to a feature film is no simple task. However, Kevin Tancharoen perfectly grounded the Mortal Kombat story while keeping the magic and fantasy roots in Mortal Kombat: Legacy (2011). Unfortunately, Simon McQuoid struggled with that balance, resulting in a script that felt like the CW team wrote.\r\n* The whole Arcana superpower thing stripped the need for skill from some of the fighters, becoming a disappointing dues ex machina. I would have preferred better writing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAll in all, there were more pros than cons, but the cons took what could have been great and made it decent. All the pros give me hope that Mortal Kombat 2 can fix the cons and make a much better sequel. Fingers crossed!",

            "The latest film in the G.I. Joe cinematic universe has arrived with \u201cSnake Eyes: GI Joe Origins\u201d. The film was originally planned to arrive in March of 2020 but faced delays due to cinematic closures during the Pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a young boy being orphaned after a group of thugs kills his father. Years later the man is still obsessed with finding out who killed his father and earns a living in underground fighting known as Snake Eyes (Henry Golding)\r\n\r\nHis exploits get the attention of Kenta (Takehiro Hira); who hires him into his organization with a promise to help him find the man who killed his father.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSnake Eyes soon finds himself working on the docks where he smuggles guns into fish bound for Japan. Despite his misgivings working for criminals, he befriends a man named Tommy (Andrew Koji); who teases him about his demeaning work by calling him \u201cFish Boy\u201d.\r\n\r\nWhen Kenta forces Snake Eyes to kill Tommy for being a spy; Snake Eyes refuses and the two make a daring escape to Japan. It is learned that Tommy is next in line to run his clan and that Kenta was banished years prior and plans revenge.\r\n\r\nDespite mistrust from a trusted associate named Akiko (Hakura Abe); Snake Eyes begins his training in the Ninja Arts which should he survive will make him a valued part of the Clan which Tommy believes is correct thanks to his Blood Debt to Snake Eyes.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on various aspects of training before branching into the larger story of divided loyalties and honors which results in a few battles and chases along the way.\r\n\r\nWhile the film does space the action out; it does provide some great cinematography and the action is entertaining even if it lacks much tension.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that the G.I. Joe/COBRA connection seems a bit forced as The Baroness (Ursula Corbero) arrives to move things along but it is mainly for the purpose of getting characters to do this and get that so the film can move towards the climactic action.\r\n\r\nSamara Weaving does show up as Scarlett but she does not have a very large part in the story and aside from a few limited action moments; she seems to be more of the token G.I.Joe representation.\r\n\r\nGolding and Hira are very good and their intertwined and complicated relationship is giving plenty of time to develop as their past is a large part of their futures and the film does a good job in explaining their past and future motivations.\r\n\r\nThe film blends Asian and Western film styles and in doing so creates an enjoyable film that for me was more enjoyable than the prior films in the series. To me those films focused mainly on action and this one was focused on developing characters.\r\n\r\nWhile it remains to be seen what direction future films in the franchise will take; it would be interesting to see more of Snake Eyes story down the line.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",

            "Bland and forgettable martial-arts thriller that delves deeper into the character but outside of Henry Goulding who was good in the role, there's not much else to the film. The rest of the cast wasn't terribly charismatic and Samara Weaving talents is completely wasted in a small supporting role (shows up basically for the third act). I don't know, while the first two GI Joe films weren't very good, there were a few entertaining moments, this one I found pretty boring for the most part, worse yet, the fight scenes suffered from bad editing and poor lighting. **2.5/5**",
            "I actually liked the two first G.I. Joe movies, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. This one\u2026 not so much.\r\n\r\nIt could have been a really good movie but it ended up as a huge disappointment. The story should have been a cool revenge story but it ended up being a convoluted mess making Snake Eyes one of the bad guys for most of the movie. It is also hugely predictable after the first 20 minutes of the movie. Did the writers really think that the \u201ctwists\u201d would come as a surprise for anyone? They probably did since Hollywod writers usually reside on the low end of the intelligence scale nowadays. Putting three of those hacks together to write a movie doesn\u2019t help of course.\r\n\r\nI could have accepted all of that if the rest would have been cool with lots of fights and special effects. Sadly the movie is mediocre, at best, in these areas as well.\r\n\r\nSnake Eyes is not only a bad guy but he is rather stupid as well as devoid of any charisma. His acting is quite poor which can be said for most of the actors actually. Apart from the mediocre acting there\u2019s really no one in the movie that you feel like rooting for. No one stands out, everyone just excels in mediocrity. The only person in the entire movie that has any coolness factor worth talking about is Scarlett but she is not in the movie for more than a few scenes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few scenes with some special effects, cars flipping over, huge snakes etc. but not really that much for this kind of movie. That could have been fine since this movie should be a lot about martial arts. Amazingly enough, not even here does it deliver. Most of the martial arts scenes involve a lot of flipping around with arms and swords but they mostly look like they have been written for a PG rated TV show for teens and pre-teens. They are simply poor. Tommy looks like he needs to take a dump before every fight with that ridiculous pose of his.\r\n\r\nThis is not a 1-star movie as some rate it. That\u2019s just ridiculous. It has some entertainment value. However, it could have been so much better. Unfortunately I suspect this movie has done the G.I. Joe franchise a disservice for some time to come.",
            "It's one thing offering us Henry Golding as a pretty chap you'd want to take home to meet your mother, it's quite another telling him to abstain from shaving for a few days and hope that turns him into a convincing, highly trained ninja! That's what is in store for us here as this latest GI Joe spin off presents our hero as the rescuer of the heir of an ancient Japanese clan - \"Tommy\" (Andrew Koji). Once he is thoroughly ingratiated with this noble family, it transpires that old \"Snake Eyes\" has an agenda all of his own - and it's not exactly honourable! The rest of the film follows a well trodden path of suspicion, betrayal, reconciliation and - of course - loads of epic looking sword fighting and gravity-defying action scenes. As with so many films in this genre, way too much emphasis has been placed on the look of the thing - the characters are instantly forgettable, the plot thinner than any rice paper could ever hope to be and the ending dragged this, quite unnecessarily, over the two hour mark.

            "After trying to move the character to more epic levels in \u2018Chronicles of Riddick\u2019, and failing to capture an audience, this third installment in the series, simply titled \u2018Riddick\u2019,  is a return-to-basics for director David Twohy. It quickly sets itself loose from the baggage of \u2018Chronicles\u2019 and pursues a more clear-cut survival action story that might as well be titled \u2018Pitch Black 2\u2018.",
            "Maybe you're all scared of the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly reactions to this, the third outing for Vin Diesel's sci-fi based anti-hero, has been very mixed. In truth it's hardly a great film of the \"must see\" kind, and it does in fact cleave very close to Pitch Black, the first and most superior of the Riddick trilogy. However, there's a whole bunch of science fiction fun to be had here.\r\n\r\nPlot has Riddick left for dead on a inhospitable planet, where he finds himself up against some alien creatures. His only hope of getting off the planet is to bring notice of his whereabouts, which brings two ships to where he is. Both with crews who have differing reasons for wanting to capture the enigmatic convict...\r\n\r\nAnd thus we get a beautifully filmed sci-fier that features beasties of both the human and alien kind. Action and moody histrionics are never far away, and Diesel is wonderfully muscular, macho, course and scary. Some of the CGI is weak, and naturally much of the film's coincidences and contrivances have to be forgiven if one wants a popcorn and beer good time of it. 7/10",
            "**(Note: This review is of the theatrical version, I have seen the uncut version and it is an improvement, but have not reviewed that edition)**\r\n\r\nIn this latest incarnation, Riddick goes boldly goes where no previous entry has gone before: Nowhere.\r\n\r\nSay what you will about the previous film (_Chronicles of Riddick_) at least it had the guts to take some risks. Sure, almost all of those ended up being complete misfires, but they were still taken. Riddick on the other hand plays it safe. It\u2019s a path not entirely without benefit, but one that was not expected from the series spawned by Australian cult-classic _Pitch Black_.\r\n\r\nShoot me for saying it but I\u2019m actually a huge fan of Davind Twohy (_The Arrival, Waterworld, G.I. Jane, A Perfect Getaway_) so I actually sort of hoped for more from the piece. Sure _Chronicles_ was silly and disjointed, sure _Dark Fury_ was totally unnecessary and _Dark Athena/Butcher Bay_ were only intermittently decent, but overall the Riddick franchise will always be compared to _Pitch Black_, and against this prodigy, the latest movie is simply subpar.\r\n\r\nThe Necromonger storyline has been all but dropped, any connections to previous characters (sans Riddick) are completely unbelievable and the events are a shameless rip off of the first film. Seeing a more \u201csurvivalist\u201d and intelligent Riddick is nice, as it\u2019s always been sort of more insinuated than outright shown. The entire world that the events of the film take place on is even moderately interesting, and none of the actors or characters are outright let downs, but overall Riddick falls much closer to the \u201cbarely watchable\u201d category than the \u201cbrilliant\u201d one.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d, it\u2019s pretty and it\u2019s most certainly entertaining, but it\u2019s not new, it\u2019s not clever, and it\u2019s most certainly not as good as _Pitch Black_.\r\n\r\n66%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",
            "The third Pitch Black film \"Riddick\" is much more focused than its predecessor and a welcome return to the formula that worked so well for the original movie. Riddick is a bad-ass survivalist fighting an extinction level event that threatens everybody, with an assembly cast that is colorful and fun to watch."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\n2018 was a disappointing year for me. A lot of letdowns regarding my most anticipated movies, and not enough surprises throughout the year. 2019, on the other hand, has been quite interesting. Most blockbusters have resonated with me, and they\u2019ve been my favorite films to watch so far (Avengers: Endgame, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Us, Glass). Additionally, original low-budget flicks have also caught my eye, and I\u2019ve been enjoying them as well, even if they\u2019re no masterpieces (Greta, Long Shot). Although, I had some bad experiences as well (Dark Phoenix, Hellboy, Godzilla: King of the Monsters). \r\n\r\nCrawl, which I honestly expected just to be a cliche-filled silly horror movie, joins this last group, and it\u2019s on par with Long Shot as the best surprise of 2019, until now. First of all, this is not a typical horror film, at least having in mind the last few examples of the genre. People might go in expecting something along the lines of Annabelle Comes Home, but with alligators, so I might as well moderate those thoughts. I wouldn\u2019t even place it in that genre, even though disaster-horror isn\u2019t exactly a bad description. It\u2019s definitely a suspense movie, almost like a survival-thriller. Haley and Dave have to fight for their lives in a race against both a hurricane and fatal predators, so I wouldn\u2019t generally put this in the horror genre. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nI love this type of films, you know that. Suspenseful, claustrophobic sequences, straightforward plot, and set in (mostly) just one location. You might think that since it\u2019s only one place to shoot and it\u2019s such a simple concept, it\u2019s easier overall, but it couldn\u2019t be more distant from the truth. With high-budget, multiple-location movies, directors and screenwriters can hide their technical flaws with tremendous VFX or huge set pieces. In one location, especially such a small one like a modest house, there\u2019s no hiding. If you want to deliver an entertaining and captivating story, you have to write an enthralling screenplay. If you want to provide scary and efficient jump scare scenes, you need to show some creativity and prove you\u2019re a talented filmmaker.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Aja, who doesn\u2019t exactly has a remarkable filmography, showcases that even with such a simplistic and short idea, it\u2019s possible to be as or more fun than a massive blockbuster. Less than 20 minutes into the film, and we\u2019re on. There\u2019s enough backstory and characterization of the main protagonist for the audience to not only care about Haley but understand what skills she has that will help her survive what comes next. I love small details like zooming in on her locking a door, closing a window, moving a piece of furniture \u2026 Every shot has meaning because it will affect the plot later on. Aja is not shooting something \u201cjust because\u201d, and that\u2019s a skill that a lot of directors struggle to have nowadays since they feel that the runtime needs to be close to the two-hour mark.\r\n\r\nAfter so many dumb, cliche, and horribly performed jump scare sequences in previous horror flicks from this year, I finally got to watch a movie where the director knows how to truly scare people, and make them jump out of their chairs. There are no loud soundtrack noises to make you screech. There are no demons or monsters in front of the screen, screaming like crazy. I was at the edge of my seat for more than a couple of times, and I genuinely got scared on some particular moments, where the surprise factor (Aja doesn\u2019t follow the cheap timings of most horror scenes) and the creativity behind the camera were top notch.\r\n\r\nObviously, the VFX and overall production design aren\u2019t mind-blowing. The alligators look pretty real, and that was the main goal, so mission accomplished. Also, being Rated-R helps the film to deliver great alligator attacks with tons of blood, and the injuries our characters have to deal with are pretty gnarly and disgusting (that\u2019s a compliment). Filming in water is extremely hard, especially in such a confined space. However, Aja and his crew were able to produce a movie where you can understand everything that\u2019s going on for the entire runtime. \r\n\r\nKaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper deliver great performances and show amazing chemistry. Their characters have enough development, even if they don\u2019t have that imaginative scripts. Crawl is one of those films where I can\u2019t point out a preeminent issue with it because it\u2019s good at every aspect. I mean, sure, there are a couple of rare moments of extreme survival, where we might think \u201che/she should be dead\u201d, but it\u2019s such a fun and entertaining time at the theater that we can let go of one or two over-the-top scenes. It\u2019s not like The Meg, where every single moment is unrealistic as hell. The success of the fictional part of a fiction movie depends on its realistic foundation and limits. If these aren\u2019t well-established, then the film will be all over the place, and its viewers won\u2019t know what to believe or not.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Crawl is one of 2019\u2019s best surprises, and I definitely recommend to see it in theaters. With compelling leads and a simple concept, Alexandre Aja delivers an entertaining, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and technically creative movie. Finally, someone who knows how to handle a camera, and provide genuinely scary jump scare sequences. Hopefully, this can catapult Kaya Scodelario to grab a bigger role on a more impactful film. I can\u2019t point out any \u201cflaws\u201d, it\u2019s simply a \u201cgood movie\u201d. With such a low-budget, give a chance to this one, and watch it instead of a massive blockbuster that will probably leave you disappointed with the numerous cliches and the extreme focus on silly action or huge set pieces as a replacement for a good story. Good job, Paramount!\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "_Crawl_ didn't changing my life or anything, but it is far and a way the best creature feature I have seen in years. Kaya Scodelario still hasn't quite got the hang of an American accent, and the very first time we see a gator it does nooot look good, but I still am very happy with what was achieved here. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",
            "Crawl is a medium budget creature horror film that\u2019s more Bait than Jaws \u2013 but with the added back drop of a massive hurricane. As if our characters weren\u2019t already in enough danger.\r\n\r\nIs Crawl a \u201cso bad its good\u201d movie, or a \u201cso bad you should avoid it\u201d movie? Read on to find out.\r\n\r\nSet in Florida during a category 5 hurricane, Crawl tells the story of Haley and her father Dave, played by Barry Pepper. After receiving a frantic phone call from her sister, Haley goes on the hunt to find her father who is trapped in their old house as the hurricane approaches. \r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to Haley, the overflow drain has been breached by Alligators, and their about to make Haley\u2019s rescue mission a whole lot more difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd if the gators don\u2019t get Haley and her dad, the rising hurricane waters will.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know much about Alligators or Hurricanes, but I do like to think I know something about logic. And that is something that is sorely lacking in most characters in this film. Even the dog.\r\n\r\nA series of unfortunate events conspire to make the rescue almost a futile effort. And the missing logic from our characters only add to the frustration to us, as the viewer. \r\n\r\nWhere should I start? First and foremost, I want to understand why neither Haley or Dave ever tried to smash out the weak looking brick work patterns on the basement wall and then crawl out of the new hole to safety? It doesn\u2019t look like the bricks would need much in the way of a good whack to break open \u2013 and considering there were tools in the basement, including the shovel that Dave uses later on to half-decapitate a gator, this bit makes no sense to me. Now I realise two things \u2013 1 is that the open brick patterns serves a purpose to flood the basement \u2013 but in reality it\u2019s the first thing anyone would think to smash open. And 2 \u2013 if they did do that, then I realise we\u2019d have a short film. But then the writers could have had more fun for the next hour putting Haley and Dave in more incredible and hard to survive scenarios. So there\u2019s a missed opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe gators that are stuck into basement with Haley and Dave also don\u2019t seem to be those of the killing variety \u2013 its either that or the skin of our two characters is so tough that these gators just can\u2019t bite through them. I\u2019m not gator expert, but I am pretty sure if one gets his whole mouth on your arm \u2013 he is probably going to bite your whole arm off, and not just leave a minor bite mark. Funny thing is we know these two gators are indeed killers, as one of them does eat the police man who comes to rescue them. \r\n\r\nAlso following up on the theme of me not being an expert on gators \u2013 one thing has me puzzled. Do gators kill for sport, or because they\u2019re hungry? I can\u2019t work that out based on this movie. \r\n\r\nAnd in something that really shocked me for an American movie \u2013 it took over an hour until we saw the first gun. That has to be some kind of record for an American horror thriller movie?\r\n\r\nBut its not all bad \u2013 because there are quite a few laugh out loud moments in this movie to lighten up the mood.\r\n\r\nI really liked the way Haley traps one of the gators in the shower. That\u2019s both clever and utterly ridiculous \u2013 that a flimsy piece of shower glass could be strong enough to hold back a gator that wants to kill.\r\n\r\nI also liked the nod to the Purge movies when the siren started just as the eye of the storm was passing through. It almost felt like a both a warning to all humans, and a sign to all gators that they could begin their hunt.\r\n\r\nIf you go into this movie realising that its not meant to be taken seriously, then its an enjoyable ride that will only briefly have you jumping in your seat over the scares and light gore. For a movie about gators hunting humans, it is surprisingly light on the gore \u2013 but then that\u2019s what happens when Hollywood makes horror movies for teen audiences.\r\n\r\nAnd there in lies the problem with this movie and someone like me watching it. It not aimed or marketed at me, and maybe not even at you. It\u2019s a forgettable popcorn flick in the same vein as Bait, but not as fun \u2013 at least that had gore to go with its killer sharks.",
            "Simple but entertaining enough, and quickly paced (running time around 80-minutes w/o credits), thriller that has just enough character development for me to care about their predicament. Not sure how much replay value this has but it's at least worth a rental. **3.5/5**",
            "The movie plot follows Hayle, who heads towards a storm in Florida to check on his father, who is not answering calls.\r\n\r\nWhen she gets there, her father is hurt and the house is surrounded by hungry and furious alligators. To make it worse, the storm causes a flooding and all this water just makes the hunt easier for the gators.\r\n\r\nThe movie has good visual effects, but the plot armor is the most absurd one I have seen in years. Against everybody else, the gators are relentless and super-effective man-killing machines, tearing anyone in pieces before they are even able to see what is attacking them. The protagonists, however, suffer only mild scratches from gator bites that would at least result in an arm or leg being torn off. \r\n\r\nThis is so frequent and so clearly absurd and unrealistic that the movie ceases to be enjoyable after a while.",
            "**Hurricanes, alligators, and a fractured father-daughter relationship - Crawl is a fun creature flick that survives it all!**\r\n\r\nCrawl is different from my usual favorite stupid shark or alligator creature features because this is not a so-bad-it\u2019s-good ridiculous movie. Instead, Crawl is a well-done creature survival thriller that creates high anxiety with claustrophobic environments filled with enraged starving alligators. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper play a father and daughter trapped in a flooding basement in the middle of a hurricane that has become the new home of some hungry crocs. The serious tone and high quality of Crawl would be comparable to The Shallows making this an excellent film as much about survival and growth as the alligators looking for dinner. The effects, well-designed sets, and great performances make Crawl a top-notch creature feature."

            "Definitely not Nolan's best but probably my favourite (at least tied with 'Batman Begins') because I love the Norwegian original so much AND the subtle changes Nolan made with it, as well as what the three stars (Al Pacino, Robin Williams--in his first villainous role, I believe, and Hilary Swank--in probably my favourite performance of hers, next to the downright decadence and naughtiness she displayed in 'The Black Dahlia') bring to the table here. I greatly enjoyed the five short extras on my DVD (a double-sided disc I bought years ago that has 'The Devil's Advocate' on the other side, yet unwatched): a conversation/interview of Nolan with Pacino; 'Day for Night: The Making of...'; 'In the Fog' (which interviewed cinematographer Wally Pfister); Nathan Crowley: production designer; and 'Eyes Wide Open' (which interviewed sleep disturbance experts), which thankfully I viewed before I watched the movie, to enhance my experience.\r\n\r\nGreatly recommended to fans of contemporary crime thrillers, regardless of whether you watched the Norwegian original or not. There are enough differences to still make it worth your while as a cinephile.",
            "Captures some human sentiment incredibly well, coupled with the unique setting and great acting, this makes Insomnia a good watch, worth every minute of its two hour runtime.\r\n\r\nThat said, I was not as enamoured by it as others might be. Perhaps if was unaware of what Nolan, Pacino or Williams are capable of at their highest levels, or if I didn't realise five minutes before the end that I'd actually seen it as a kid and could exclusively remember the ending, then it would have had a higher impact on me.\r\n\r\nBut even taken for me as is, _Insomnia_ is still a very solid bit of filmmaking.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece  of the puzzle. And a bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him.\r\n\r\nInsomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg and Nikolaj Frobenius (1997 screenplay). It stars Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan and Nicky Katt. Music is scored by David Julyan and cinematography by Wally Pfister. It's a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.\r\n\r\nLAPD detective Will Dormer (Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart (Donovan) travel to the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute to aid the local cops investigating the savage murder of a teenage girl. But Dormer leaves behind an Internal Affairs Investigation that gnaws away at him, and when a potential bust of the murder suspect goes tragically wrong, his conscious gets attacked on two fronts. By lack of sleep and by the killer himself.\r\n\r\nIt's a House of Cards.\r\n\r\nViewing from afar it's easy to be cynical and suggest that Insomnia is just an American remake cash in. Bigger budget, bigger stars and directed by an indie darling of the critics moving into the big league. While on the surface the plot looks to be another in a long line of cops and villains thrillers where procedural unfolds and evil is ultimately brought down at the end. Yet Insomnia is so much more than that, it's a deep movie dealing in complex psychological issues, a blanc-noir of some character substance, a picture clinically put together around one mans descent into a private hell, with the beautiful Alaskan backdrop perversely claustrophobic and Anthony Mann like in being at one with Will Dormer's fragmented state of mind.\r\n\r\nKilling changes you. You know that.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening moments as we observe a biplane flying over the Alaskan glaciers, accompanied by David Julyan's nerve tingling score, there's a looming air of disquiet. Nolan knows his noir onions, mood is everything and the dense psychological atmosphere is never once breached for the entire movie. Much of the picture is dialogue heavy, gratifyingly so, with the hushed conversations between Pacino and Williams begging the viewer to hang on every word as cop and killer (no spoiler, it's revealed to us early as a necessity) jostle for control of each others soul. What action there is also comes with a side order of otherworldly delights, a chase across floating logs and a stalk through eerie fog being the two particular highlights.\r\n\r\nSleep comes at a cost.\r\n\r\nWith three Oscar winners in the cast Nolan had some serious quality to direct, that Pacino, Williams and Swank deliver excellence is high praise for the British director. Pacino actually gives one of his finest late career performances, utterly compelling as Dormer, his haggard face tells of a thousand sorrows, his sleep deprived gait befits a man staring into the abyss. Wally Pfister's photography is on the money, the blend of snow whites and green tinges sparkle from the vistas and the soft brown hues inside the hotel provide the rare moments of tranquillity available to Will Dormer. Across the board Insomnia is a cracker of a movie, a film that goes into the murky depths of the genre to reveal one of the best movies of 2002. 9/10",
            "A relatively normal Christopher Nolan movie? Well I never!\r\n\r\n<em>'Insomnia'</em> might not be as deeply entwined as what the director usually produces, yet in entertainment terms it is still right up there. I really enjoyed this one, thanks in large part to the performances of Al Pacino and Robin Williams - great to see those two icons onscreen together! You also have some nice visuals, Alaska looks real neat!",
            "Haven't watched this one in a while but been on an Al Pacino kick lately. Still holds up and features some great performances from Pacino and Williams. I would've loved to have been a fly on the wall behind the scenes with those two along with Christopher Nolan in his first bigger budget feature ($46 million). Not one of the best crime-thrillers but still well worth a watch. **4.0/5**"

            "First and foremost, this film feels like someone went to their local grocery store, grabbed a random three-dollar mystery novel off the checkout shelf, and decided to make it a movie with some extremely popular and attractive people. In other words, it's a silly mystery movie with crazy, zany twists and turns.\r\n\r\nSome of those twists and turns were easy enough to see coming, but some of them were straight out of left field. In addition to the entertaining twists, the film does a decent job of not taking itself seriously. The humor in the movie is peppered in during great moments. Some of it is cheesy, but if you're going to this film for a deep, thought-provoking film, don't.\r\n\r\nThe characters themselves are all extremely exaggerated. Lively's Emily is over-the-top sophisticated, crass, and private to the point where she won't allow pictures or even paintings of her face. Kendrick's Stephanie is bubbly, eager, awkward, and overly friendly. The rest of the cast fills in the needs around them, and while the cast is filled with one-note characters, they fulfill the needs well. Golding's Sean was my least favorite, but mainly because he doesn't have a defined archetype in a film filled with single-aspect characters.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the film is the plot itself. Emily contradicts herself with the motive for her faking her own death. She tells Sean that she did it for him and for Nicky. Then she says she did it for her. On top of it all, she doesn't appear to have a plan to get the insurance money after it comes through. The film could have easily alleviated all of these issues with a quick scene or a line about fake passports for Emily and Nicky.\r\n\r\nAll in all, A Simple Favor is a fun romp filled with crazy twists and turns, humor, and great acting. Don't think too much about the film itself, and just go have some fun. It's definitely worth a getaway matinee.",

More recently, novels such as Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel, _Gone Girl_ (and David Fincher's 2014 filmic adaptation), have expanded and popularised the suburban noir genre; the very genre that _A Simple Favour_'s satirical excesses primarily target. A comedic look at the lives of two young mothers in an affluent American suburb, coupled with a mystery plot, the film has an undeniable identity crisis due to its genre mash-up characteristics (it's a comic/satirical suburban noir murder mystery thriller). Although director Paul Feig proves adept at handling the parodic side of things, in the latter stages, he seems to be trying to ensure the film can exist (relatively) un-ironically within the very genre it's attempting to lampoon. And he doesn't particularly succeed. Despite this schizophrenic quality, however, the interplay between the two leads, the heavy stylisation, the playfully self-aware nature of the aesthetic, and the success of the burlesque elements all serve to make the film undeniably entertaining.\r\n\r\nAdapted by Jessica Sharzer from Darcey Bell's 2017 novel, _A Simple Favour_ tells the story of Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a widowed single-mum who runs a life hacks vlog with minimal viewership. Overzealous in her desire to be liked, to the point where she's deeply unlikable, Stephanie is the kind of person who signs up for every volunteer project at her son's school, and then feigns surprise when she's told she can only work on one at a time. Enter Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), a public relations executive for a major fashion label. When Miles (Joshua Satine) and Nicky (Ian Ho), Stephanie and Emily's sons, respectively, ask for a playdate, Emily is initially unenthusiastic. However, she acquiesces, and she and Stephanie are soon bonding over increasingly strong martinis and girl chats, with Stephanie in awe of Emily, who seems to have it all; a good-looking novelist/lecturer husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a gorgeous house, a successful career, a great kid, and an acerbic attitude that Stephanie would kill for. However, all is not as perfect as it first seems; there are not insignificant financial problems; when Stephanie takes a photograph of Emily, Emily reacts angrily, demanding Stephanie delete it; although she and Sean have a great physical relationship, there isn't much else there, with Emily frustrated that his only successful novel was published over ten years ago. Several weeks later, with Emily held up at work, she asks Stephanie to pick up Nicky, and she'll collect him later. Except she doesn't collect him. As a few days go by, and no one seems to know where Emily is, Stephanie and Sean report her missing. However, unsatisfied with the direction the investigation is taking, Stephanie is soon amateur sleuthing her way across the country in an effort to track down her friend.\r\n\r\nObviously taking inspiration from suburban-based \"mommy murder mysteries\" such as _Gone Girl_ and Paula Hawkins's 2012 _The Girl on the Train_, as well as films such as Stanley Donen's _Charade_ (1963), _A Simple Favour_ is at its best when working as a parody/satire of such narratives, its own source material included. From what little I know of the book, it seems as if everything is played straight, with little discernible sense of sarcasm, even as the plot twists become ever more ludicrous. With this in mind, it makes sense that the filmmakers have elected to adapt such un-ironically thrashy material in a more self-reflexive manner, as this facilitates the gentle (and often not so gentle) ribbing of the genre, exposing some of its more ill-conceived and unrealistic tropes to ridicule. For example, the three main characters are all standard generic templates to the point of clich\u00e9; the _ing\u00e9nue_ who feels honour-bound to do everything she can to find the truth, no matter the cost, ultimately learning as much about herself as anything else; the sardonic, caustic, and utterly shady plot catalyst, who always seems to have an ace up her sleeve and always seems to know more than anyone else; and, the brilliant but frustrated spouse who may, or may not, be in on the crime at the narrative's centre. However, their archetypal characteristics are dialled up to such a degree (Stephanie is the definition of innocence, Emily is the type of person that simply doesn't exist in the real world, Sean is impossibly attractive, funny, intelligent, and kind), that they can't help but seem caricatures. Similarly, everything is presented in such a nonchalant and laid back manner that the twists, which in a more self-serious film would occupy centre stage, are often rendered absurd. However, and this is the key point, _A Simple Favour_ is very much in on the joke. Most of the time.\r\n\r\nOpening with a late 1960s Europop-influenced Saul Bass-esque title sequence complete with sliding split-screens and pastel colours, scored to Jean Paul Keller's 1967 \"Ca s'est arrange\", the film signals its playful tone right from the off. This emphasis on stylisation is perhaps seen most clearly upon Emily's introduction. As Stephanie, Miles, and Nicky shelter from the rain, Emily emerges from a car in slow motion, with the camera starting on her feet before slowly moving up to her head as she raises an umbrella. Cutting to a mid-shot, she then begins to walk across the carpark (still in slow motion), as a broken umbrella blows past her, replacing the tumbleweed of a classic western shootout. Apart from being a memorable introduction to the character, the visual design of the scene is predicated on cine-literacy, showing that the filmmakers are more than aware of standard genre tropes, and, more importantly, how to employ them for comedic effect.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the entire film revels in its own intertextual awareness, with later references to such defining noir texts as George Cukor's _Gaslight_ (1944), Alfred Hitchcock's _Spellbound_ (1945), and Henri-Georges Clouzet's _Les diaboliques_ (1955). Another element of this awareness is the use of a fractured narrative structure, so beloved of classic noir mysteries. Large portions of the film feature narration within narration (and oftentimes narration within narration within narration), as well as making use of another classic noir staple; the unreliable narrator. The film gets significant mileage out of scenes where the aural narration doesn't even come close to matching the visuals; i.e., the narrator is lying, and both the narratee and the audience are aware of such. An especially funny example of this is when Stephanie tells Emily about kissing her step-brother after their father's funeral, and Emily immediately knows she is lying that she only kissed him (leading to her new nickname for Stephanie, \"_brotherfucker_\"). Whilst the narrator (Stephanie) flat-out denies she slept with him, the audience sees them having sex, confirming the narratee's (Emily) suspicions. This technique is used several times in the film, and it's an extremely well-handled narrative device.\r\n\r\nThe film's main target for satire, however, is not really a specific genre (suburban noir) or even the tropes that define that genre \u2013 it's the _milieu_ that enables the existence of that genre in the first place. Together, Stephanie, Emily, and Sean represent everything that's rotten with the sterilised, emotionally deadening middle-class suburban sphere in which they're (seemingly) trapped. However, the film doesn't condemn them for being horrible people, rather it exults in their awfulness, deftly directing, redirecting, and misdirecting the audience's sympathies, to the point where it becomes difficult to say who is screwing over whom. Every time the film seems to settle on who the villains are, it does something to disrupt the audience's perceptions, and oftentimes, so as to achieve maximum satirical impact, precisely when the character we are now being asked to empathise with is up to something somewhat less than moral. This is the very essence of black comedy \u2013 the film presents a hideous world populated by hideous people who do hideous things to one another, but it does so in such a cheerful and uplifting manner that you simply can't help but laugh at the shenanigans.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this, the film works especially well when jauntily charting the friendship between Stephanie and Emily, two women who have no businesses co-existing. I don't particularly understand Anna Kendrick's popularity. Although she seems perfectly amiable in real-life, she plays the exact same character in every film, and that character is Anna Kendrick. However, it works here because, a) it's the perfect foil to the \"screw-you\" persona of Emily, and b) Kendrick and Lively have such effortless chemistry (it's one of those films that, as you watch, you know they had a blast making). The two women are just so fundamentally different that it wouldn't take much to make their early scenes together work, but everything is in place to amplify the comedy \u2013 the lively script, the great acting, the unintrusive direction, the brightly-lit and garish interiors, the clashing wardrobes. Lively plays Emily as a mischievous, experienced charmer, the kind of person who acts like they know your secrets ten seconds after meeting you, whilst Kendrick's Stephanie is all self-deprecating intellectualism, trailed-off sentences, and statements phrased like questions. Frankly, I could have watched two hours of just the two of them trading good-natured barbs, pushing each other's buttons, and swapping sex stories.\r\n\r\nIf there was one element of the film that didn't work, however, it was the mystery plot. Yes, I get that it's all a satire of the multi-twist-for-twist's-sake suburban murder mystery, with the preposterousness of such plots played for maximum farcicality. However, the satirical underpinning doesn't change the fact that the entire mystery at the film's centre is insipid, uninteresting, and predictable, whilst Feig seems patently unable to bridge the tone of the frothier comic moments and the darker ones which become increasingly prevalent towards the end. Granted, the film is not a spoof, \u00e0 la something like Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker's _Airplane!_ (1980), so we can't expect absurdist humour throughout, but nevertheless, rather than choosing to employ a relatively even tone, Feig seems to have made the decision to mix scenes of outright comedy with predominantly serious scenes devoid of laughter. And it doesn't work. For example, the film features a scene in which someone who has just been ploughed by a car and is trying to crawl away is nonchalantly told if they don't stop, they're going to hurt their knees. That's pretty dark, but it's also pretty funny. However, it comes only a short while after a scene in which a drug-addict is held under the water and drowned. Not a huge amount to laugh at there. If scenes of this nature are supposed to be satiric, and hence feed into the film's engagement with the suburban noir, I couldn't see any evidence of it, and as a result, the tonal disparity becomes very jarring towards the end.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, I found _A Simple Favour_ enjoyable. The purely-satirical early scenes earn enough goodwill so that the less successful more plot-heavy later scenes don't completely tear the whole thing down. The film as a whole shines a not unwelcome light on the increasingly self-important suburban noir, and for the most part, the parody is very well-judged. When the comedy is forced to retreat in the service of more serious material, the tonal balance is definitely knocked off, as the film comes dangerously close to valorising that which it has set out to mock. Despite this, however, _A Simple Favour_ remains entertaining. Distractingly attractive people wear ridiculously stylish clothes in a stylised cine-literate parody \u2013 it won't change your life, but it's a very rewarding couple of hours.",

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nWith all due respect to Roland Emmerich and to his fantastic Independence Day, his movies never quite reach their potential, ending up in constant disappointments. It doesn't matter if he has excellent casts or amazing VFX teams, his films' screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues. Midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns. Without knowing the director, anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated. From the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals, it has two attention-grabber ingredients, which can result in a remarkable film\u2026 only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough: story and characters.\r\n\r\nThese are the main issue with Emmerich's movies. His characters are not compelling or intriguing enough, and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement (whether these are written by him or someone else). When I noticed that Midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the Battle of Midway, I immediately got excited. War epics are a genre that I sincerely appreciate. However, when I checked who was \"running the show\", I instantly lowered my expectations. Honestly, it's exactly what I expected it to be: visually gripping, but emotionally hollow.\r\n\r\nI don't want to understate it. The CGI work in this film is jaw-dropping. The actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design. Even at a regular screening with the usual 7.1 Dolby surround speakers, the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes. This is why I think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie. Maybe not a vast majority, but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment. It has a long runtime, and it's hard to get through the exposition-heavy story, but in the end, I bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's still a very superficial flick. While it's very respectful to everyone who fought in the war (including the Japanese) and to the historic event on itself, it lacks emotional attachment to its characters. Dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world, but its main criticism connects to what I just wrote. Christopher Nolan's film also didn't have any compelling characters. However, there's a big difference between these two movies. Both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct. Dunkirk was all about showing the actual war. It never marketed itself as a character-study or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there. Nolan repeated several times: it's about the war and the war only.\r\n\r\nIt's genuinely one of the best, if not the best, *pure* war film I've ever seen. When it comes to depicting the claustrophobic, unbreathable, restless, bloody, loud event that a devastating war is, Dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair (at least, I did in IMAX). On the other hand, Midway's marketing was about paying homage to \"people who fought in the Battle of Midway\". Hence the stellar cast compared to Nolan's just competent actors (with obvious exceptions like Mark Rylance or Tom Hardy). It spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle, not with the action itself. Therefore, these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs.\r\n\r\nWes Tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic. Characters discuss specific topics that don't make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place. Throughout the runtime, there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story, which ends up turning the narrative confusing, convoluted, and lacking faster pacing. It's tough to get through the non-action periods, and I can't even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast. Ed Skrein remarkably portrays Dick Best, the only character who's genuinely compelling and carries a complete, well-developed arc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't feel invested in any other character. Only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role. Midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell. In addition to this, it has to stretch its runtime because you can't get Woody Harrelson or Dennis Quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines. As time goes by, Emmerich's storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow. It's yet another film added to the \"wasted potential\" list\u2026\r\n\r\nPotential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be. It's undeniable that these are entertaining, gripping, and exciting. The dive bombers' scenes are packed with so much tension that I was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target, and a bomb went into the sea. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary. Midway's war is as close to epic as it could be, but as with every other cinematic production, if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action, there are no outstanding VFX that can save a lousy screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the Battle of Midway, but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters. With more characters that what it needed, the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didn't have more than a couple of lines. Roland Emmerich has to thank his VFX team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle. Truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences, plus a powerful sound design, get your teeth biting the nails. Unfortunately, except for Ed Skrein's character, I didn't feel invested enough to appreciate the non-action moments due to the confusing, convoluted, and exposition-heavy narrative. It's a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story. However, I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and \"based on a true story\" adaptations.\r\n\r\nPS: it doesn\u2019t hurt to research a bit about the Battle of Midway. I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m sort of regretting that now. Don\u2019t make the same mistake. Going in with basic knowledge of what, how, and why it happened will only help you enjoy this movie more.\r\n\r\nRating: C+",
            "***Just the facts, Jack***\r\n\r\nIntelligence officer Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns that a Japanese attack is imminent, but his advice is disregarded and the Japanese use their carrier fleet to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, \tevents lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4\u20137, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William \"Bull\" Halsey. \r\n\r\n\"Midway\" (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d (2001). While I loved \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d and proudly stand by it, \u201cMidway\u201d chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there\u2019s a tribute to each at the close.  \r\n\r\nThis is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii. The flick successfully takes the viewer right into the midst of the fight on the water, in the air and under the water. It\u2019s exciting, horrific and revelatory.   \r\n\r\nThe film runs almost 2 hours and 18 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

            "Admittedly I have a love for anything involving World War II and although the dialogue was a bit spotty and some of the visual effects were okay at best, I still found this to be a pretty good war movie and nice performances all around. Probably doesn't rank all that high compared to others about Midway and Pearl Harbor, yet still found it to be worth checking out. **3.75/5**",
            "Click here for a video version of this review: youtu.be/2Mr6XRF4GR4\r\n\r\n_Midway_ is an ambitous film that sets out to follow the United States entry into World War Two, from the attack on Pearl Harbour through to the Battle of Midway. To tell this story it focuses on two main characters who are also based on real life people. There's Ed Skrein playing Dick Best, a pilot on the USS Enterprise, and Patrick Wilson playing intelligence officer Edwin Layton.\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine jamming seven months of war into just over two hours is a big task, and while they did manage to pull this off, the result is a movie that feels rushed, where we can't get to know all the many characters, and which probably requires a pretty strong knowledge of this time period in history to understand all the things that are rapidly being thrown on screen.\r\n\r\nI actually had a lot of trouble telling who was who in many of the scenes involving the pilots. Apart from Ed Skrein and Luke Evans the rest of the pilots and rear gunners are such a copy / paste of each other and they come and go so fast on screen that you have zero time to have any kind of emotional connection to them, even though the movie tries to make you feel for them. For a lead actor, Skrein is very wooden and uninspiring, and I don't think has shoulders big enough to carry his part of the film.\r\n\r\nThen, as if the 10,000 mile an hour story is not bad enough, this movie relies very heavily on visual effects. Apart from close-ups, everything you see that involves a ship or a plane is entirely CGI and it is woefully bad 99% of the time. I've used the Playstation analogy a lot, and this is another example. I feel like if they had cut back the story to not cover so many fights and battles, there would have been a lot less visual effect shots. And with less shots to create and render, perhaps those remaining would have come out looking more realistic. As it is, it really takes you out of the movie - the planes move like they are weightless and defy the laws of physics, the explosions look they were made in AfterEffects, and each scene on a ship has that horrible green screen glow about it.\r\n\r\nIn summary I think this movie suffers from trying to do too much all at once. This came off feeling more like a trilogy of movies about Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid, and The Battle of Midway had been edited down to one single movie. The end result is a rushed film that is hard to follow, whose characters are difficult to connect with, and whose visual effects are video game level at best. This will not go down in history as a great war film.",
            "This movie was a bit of a positive surprise. I was actually prepared to not like it that much but Hollywood actually made a decent war movie without pushing their usual left wing political propaganda and woke SJW bullshit.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s really a good movie in pretty much all aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst, I liked that it covers quite a bit more than \u201cjust\u201d Midway. It actually starts before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Then it covers the attack on Perl Harbor and also the famous Dolittle raid on Tokay to finally end up with the battle of Midway. All of it is more or less historically accurate. We also get to see a fair amount of the history from the viewpoint of the Japanese. Whether that bit of the story is actually entirely accurate I guess no one will ever know of course.\r\n\r\nI also liked that they took the effort to get all Japanese actors (or Japanese looking at least) playing the Japanese side and that they spoke Japanese all the time. That\u2019s the kind of thing that gives the right atmosphere for those parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe acting was overall good on both sides. I quite liked Woody Harrelson as Nimitz. Ed Skrein was probably the actor I felt made the most mediocre performance but that might just be me.\r\n\r\nOf course there can be no war movie without things going boom and this movie didn\u2019t disappoint on that. It has plenty of action, lots of flight scenes and lots of thing being blown up and it was overall well made. The effects when large ships got torpedoed, bombed or when their munitions exploded was quite realistic. You could see the ships shuddering and the effect on the water around it.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something it was that the movie is too short. Given the large time period it covers there is so much material that it could easily have been longer. It almost felt a bit rushed. There could have been much more suspense around the battle of Midway itself and the part of how they got Yorktown operational, and hid the fact from the Japanese, in time for the battle was altogether left out for example.\r\n\r\nThe movie was 2 hours 18 minutes long which is respectable but not that long by today\u2019s standards. All three of the extended Lord of the Rings movies was three and a half hours long and this one could easily have been as long.",
            "I am not a fan of war movies (and therefore not an authoritative reviewer) so I can only say that I thought it was fairly entertaining. Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quaid were as good as I would expect them to be and the large cast certainly held their own.\r\n\r\nI felt there were some war movie cliches here and there, but the Japanese were portrayed with respect and, I assume, realism. The battle felt like a very near thing to me, like it could easily have gone the other way with a bit less bravery and persistence on the part of the American fliers. Plus it showed only two planes returning in the end, but someone said they lost half their men. Perhaps the rest landed on different carriers and was just unclear. But as I said, I knew little of the details of the battle going in."

            "Infinity Pool is a horny, horrifying look at ego and self-indulgence based on self-doubt and failure. The film follows novelist James Foster (Alexander Skarsgard) as he is mesmerized by Gabi (Mia Goth) resulting in a stained week of violence and debauchery. \r\n\r\nThe plot is a story of two halves, the first being incredibly strong as the audience is learning the mystery behind the experiments, guests and their past.

Although, after X, Pearl, and now Infinity Pool, I would like to see her do some more diverse work, but she has nailed this type of character. Alexander Skarsgard is also great with some emotionally engrossing scenes mixed with cold, emotionless scenes that create an interesting dichotomy for the characters headspace.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film slightly stumbles towards the end and might have a bit of a bloated run time, there is still a ton to enjoy with a creative story, mind bending cinematography, and powerhouse performances.\r\n\r\nScore: 77%\r\nVerdict: Great",

            "It\u2019s not the worst remake of all time, but it\u2019s just ordinary. It\u2019s bland, lifeless, vanilla, and feels like what the Lifetime Channel in America would do to a remake of the Tobe Spielberg classic haunting film. I think the only reason Gil Kenan was hired for this movie was because the movie is based around a monster house and he depicted a monster so well in his last film that the job only seemed like a no brainer. The problem is Kenan forgets to produce likable characters and interesting scares during the process of producing an evil possessed house. - _Zevi Wolmark_",
            "> Would have been a better film if it was an original.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary to compare this with the original and I tried, but impossible to avoid it since it's an official remake. Everything, from the house to frame by frame, all the scenes looked the same, except the cast and it's set in the present world with the daily life's modern gadgets. If you had not seen the 80s film, then there's a little chance you might like it. Though it was not a serious horror movie, or a scary movie to consider, still quite enjoyable like a dark comedy in parts. But I recommend the old one.\r\n\r\nReally? Sam Rockwell? He did not fit in the role, just okay though. And the kids, did not impress me as like the original movie. The only upgrade in this new version was the technology, CRT monitors to LED kind of stuffs. I expected a major, at least a bit alteration in the story or the screenplay that sets in a different circumstances and the location. That could have been a lot better. Disappoints for those who loved the first version. However, that movie deserved to be remade, and I did not think it would end like this. Hoping for a better sequel, but I'm already feeling that would end in the hands of the second string cast and crew which could be a cheap horror-thrill.\r\n\r\n5/10",
            "I had huge reservations about watching this remake, which I felt was completely unnecessary. It wasn't as bad as I had anticipated, and that the bad reviews at the time gave me the impression I should fear or avoid watching it. The special effects were pretty good, and Sam Rockwell, Jared Harris and Jane Adams (how wonderful it was to see her again, after her exceptional work in 'Happiness'!) sold the film for me. I knew what to expect after liking, but not loving, director Gil Kenan's earlier animated 'Monster House', but I was intrigued how his energetic directing would transfer to live-action work.\r\n\r\nI think they could have made it more suspenseful and scary, but I'm not really sure that was their intention. I think they were going for a family experience with some thrills, chills and laughs...such as the recent 'Ghostbusters' remake was going for. If that was the case, then in that regard it was quite successful. I'm looking forward to re-watching this eventually with my 13-year-old son, horror-film aficionado, Julian, who like me adored the original.\r\n\r\nIf I was to make the perfect 'Poltergeist' film, I would have taken the same exact Steven Spielberg script and simply updated the special effects. I think that would have been a more successful approach.",
            "The movie blurb is written by some 20th Century Fox representative. I would guess that the person in question has not even watched the original movie. \u201cLegendary film makers\u201d? What a load of bull! These people have not produced anything really worth watching and this movie certainly do not improve on that score. I mean, how dumb are these people from 20th Century Fox? I certainly hope the audience are not dumb enough to fall for this obvious lie. Judging from the, well deserved mediocre score on various review sites I guess they did not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as for the movie. It is a bleak (cheap) shadow of the original. It has absolutely zero of the charm that the original movie had and, most importantly, none of the characters had anything of the charisma that the original characters had. The father is a total dumbass and an irresponsible at that. The mother could by just any Hollywood style housewife.\r\n\r\nWhen you finally think that something interesting would happen, that is when the ghost hunter enters the scene, it just falls flat again. He is just totally lacking in appeal. He is neither a bad ass nor is he mysterious or anything else that makes him worth watching.\r\n\r\nThere are just so much things wrong with the story as well. How can this guy afford and get a one for a house when he apparently do not seem to have a job? He even manages to go for another house in the end after his original one apparently got shredded. How bloody dumb is the script writer? In the original it was a new neighbourhood which explained the \u201ctroubles\u201d. In this one it is not which means that the script writer obviously had zero understanding of the original plot which brings us back to the same question again. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nThere are some half decent CGI scenes in this movie but the same can be said for a lot of things coming out of the movie industry nowadays (well with the exception of SyFy productions of course).\r\n\r\nI would say that as a TV-movie it would have been above average. As a remake of a classic it totally falls flat. I am happy that I watched it at home and did not spend time going to a theatre watching it.",
            "Lame horror.\r\n\r\n<em>'Poltergeist'</em> offers nothing. It may not be an absolutely awful watch, but there's nothing about this that's good unfortunately. The story is largely predictable and plain, none of the cast give anything close to a performance that's worth remembering. There aren't many, if any, scares either - not great for a film in this genre.\r\n\r\nAs for the onscreen talent, it's slim pickings... not even Jared Harris' late appearance could save things. If I had to pick a standout, away from Harris, it would be Sam Rockwell. The two youngest kids, Kyle Catlett and Kennedi Clements, aren't terrible in fairness.\r\n\r\nNot one I'll be revisiting.

            "Matt Johnson's rather John McEnroe-esque \"Doug\" rather stole this tale of what was literally a tech-tonic shift in how we used our mobile phones. He, together with his boss Mike (Jay Baruchel), has been working with a small team of geeks to develop a mobile word processor that can send messages by text and email. It's funding they lack and it's during a fairly flawed presentation that they encounter \"Jim\" (Glenn Howerton), a savvy operator who knows just enough about the business to get them that elusive big deal. Thing is, they don't think they have the processing capacity to service this ever increasing share of the market even if their new pal is generating eye-watering business opportunities. A 46% market share of what became the exponentially burgeoning smartphone market offered them real potential to dominate for years - but history tells us just what did happen. This film benefits from not really having a big star at the helm. The three men juggle the pressures, successes and failures delivering a solid and at times quite funny story of the rise and falls of a company that, when faced with difficulties, resorted to an emergency movie night! It doesn't shy away from depicting some of the sharper practices at play in this supremely competitive business, but it delivers in a far less aggressive fashion. Maybe it's a Canadian thing, but I found myself actually wanting them to succeed (even if I actually ended up loathing my own \"Crackberry\"). So many of these true stories are based on characters seeking easy money - this is based on a pair of guys who actually made something; and something that set a benchmark for kit we all use across the world without a second thought nowadays. Enjoyable to watch and worth two hours of your time.",
            "\u201cBlackberry\u201d is a film about the failure and spectacular collapse of the world\u2019s first smart phone. Adapting Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff\u2019s book \u201cLosing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry\u201d for the screen, director Matt Johnson creates an entertaining look at contemporary history with his tale of the rise and fall of a revolutionary gadget that changed the world forever.\r\n\r\nIn this unconventional story of modern business failure at the hands of fraud and greed, the film tells the history of Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton), the two men responsible for the creation and marketing of the BlackBerry smart phone. It was one of the first of its kind, featuring a pocket device (with a keyboard) that could be used for calls, texts and e-mail messaging. It was a revolutionary idea that was dismissed by many of the major players, until Balsillie saw a massive opportunity in the product and the nerdy co-founders of the company. Lazaridis and his partner Doug (Johnson) lacked business savvy and the know-how to deal with the sharks who dominated the world of corporate technology, and Balsillie became the pitbull they needed to whip the business into shape and bring in the discipline needed to run a tight, successful company.\r\n\r\nThe film takes viewers through the BlackBerry timeline from concept to eventual defeat, starting in 1996 up until 2016. The mid-nineties seems like a time that was so far away, but it wasn\u2019t that long ago. (Being transported back to a world without a smart phone in every pocket is nearly unimaginable nowadays). The film has a retro look and feel that\u2019s very corporate and drab, which is a great fit for the material, and Johnson\u2019s storytelling is comprehensive but always entertaining, with a good mix of business-oriented drama and light comedy.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting parts of the story are when PalmPilot CEO Carl Yankowski (Cary Elwes) hints at a hostile takeover, but Balsillie outthinks him by launching a grassroots marketing campaign that made the Blackberry a highly sought after status symbol. He saved the company, which makes for an eventual bittersweet demise. On the other hand, he also directly led to its end with some shady stock manipulation that got him in trouble with the SEC.\r\n\r\nThe film is well cast with standout work from Baruchel, especially when he begins to crack with the realization that Apple is getting ready to kill his invention and his company with their upcoming iPhone, a product with the highest consumer interest of any item in history. The characters are flawed human beings (and in the case of Balsillie, a total jerk), but they aren\u2019t impossible to root for.\r\n\r\nUltimately a reflection on failure, \u201cBlackBerry\u201d is an interesting and fun film about the competitiveness of Silicon Valley and the men who made some massive mistakes on their journey to the top. Their position at the highest rung of the tech world was brief, crippled by the innovators at Apple.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",
            "The script seems to be written mostly from the perspective of Jim Balsillie, a businessman that was co-CEO of Blackberry, while engineers take a backseat. This follows the general tendency in film to glorify businessmen, treating the people who actually conceptualize, design and implement the products (i.e., do the core work that is societally useful) as mere sidekicks.\r\n\r\nThe general timeline is right and many of the major events in the history of Blackberry are there, but none are described in enough detail for viewers to appreciate the engineering successes that led to Blackberry rising to global prominence, nor the business mismanagement that tanked it.\r\n\r\nThe engineering details that made it in are often confused or misleading (e.g., Blackberry did not invent push messaging, and their prototype wasn't pulled from thin air overnight). It gives the impression most of the source material came from interviews with non-technical people, or else \"Great Man\" personality drama was the only material the filmmakers understood well enough to put in a script.\r\n\r\nThe film has confusingly mixed messaging. It perpetuates the notion that engineers are tinkering children that get nothing done without big daddy managers pushing them to work long hours and \"just make it work\", damn the technical details! Yet it repeatedly also tries to show the businessmen as hustlers that use bluster and hand waving to cover up their general uselessness and technical incompetence, as well as the resulting harmful decisions they make that ultimately resulted in the downfall of Blackberry. Perhaps the writers wanted to portray Balsillie as a clever shark, but based on his actions in the film alone you would think he was largely a egomaniacal leech that the meek engineers could not figure out how to get rid of. Indeed it is unclear why the engineers brought him on to begin with - they probably would have been better off without him and the other businessmen he brought on.",
            "I kept hearing people say this movie was actually not bad for a movie about BalckBerry, and you know what, they were right! Glenn Howerton plays an incredibly entertaining psycho as always. Jay Baruchel does the befuddled muppet thing with aplomb. And then the doofus sidekick guy who's actually more insightful than others give him credit for also does a good job. It's an easy mindless entertainment watch. Spoiler alert, the company does really well then it doesn't.",
            "In one sense, this is a comedic action film. In another sense, it's a biopic of a lying, cheating, ruthless, tech businessman of a slightly less rank than Bezos, Zuckerberg and the \"Don't be Evil\" Page/Brin team.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's brilliantly cast and paced. It moves along at the perfect clip for this kind of action film. I was interested in the technology, but that truly wasn't the story.",
            "With the release of such innovative communications products as the Apple and Android smartphones, questions began to circulate about the future viability of onetime market leader BlackBerry, a line of devices that subsequently went into rapid decline. Ironically, that real-life business world narrative itself raises comparable questions about the viability of a movie that tells the BlackBerry story. Nevertheless, writer-director Matt Johnson\u2019s third feature outing brings the ill-fated account of the rise and fall of this Canadian-made smartphone company in the global telecommunications marketplace. Seeing how the company was run, however, it probably shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise why it ultimately failed \u2013 shady financial management, ego-driven unbridled greed, undisciplined employees and constant managerial scrambling to remain competitive, despite some surprisingly savvy marketing aimed at making the BlackBerry an enviable status symbol, especially among business clients. But is this kind of material really sufficiently engaging for a feature film? I sure don\u2019t think so, especially since it\u2019s about a company and product that ultimately flopped. It\u2019s a cinematic exercise akin to \u201cThe Gang That Couldn\u2019t Shoot Straight\u201d (1971) trying to take on Silicon Valley giants. The film also gets exceedingly technical at times, making for a film that cyber nerds may find awesomely cool but that casual viewers are likely to see as tedious and confusing. And, by the picture\u2019s second half, with the handwriting on the wall and the parade of unending snafus continuing, it\u2019s difficult to maintain interest in how events unfold and eventually play out. To its credit, this release features some fine performances, most notably by Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside and Independent Spirit Award nominee Glenn Howerton, as well as an excellent and often-ironic soundtrack. However, in a larger sense, \u201cBlackBerry\u201d also represents a somewhat disconcerting trend in movies that\u2019s gaining traction \u2013 films based on the back stories of products and businesses. Besides this offering, 2023 also saw the release of films about sneakers (\u201cAir\u201d), videogame retailing (\u201cDumb Money\u201d) and even snack foods (\u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot\u201d). While there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with pictures about business and commerce, these offerings are innately little more than two-hour feature-length commercials for their wares. Indeed, are these commodities becoming our new screen idols? It calls to mind actor Paul Newman\u2019s observation years ago about the emergence of a robot and a shark becoming our new movie icons, but, as different as they were, even they weren\u2019t as shamelessly commercial as these new contenders are. Releases like this should indeed give us all pause to think about what kinds of movies we want to plunk down our hard-earned money to watch.",

There were some bits that sort of reminded me of last year's _Darkest Minds_, and that's definitely a bad thing, but overall it was actually pretty decent. It goes for both the social commentary, and a *pew pew splodey zap zap* action crime thriller. It doesn't work **spectacularly** as either, but it tries, and its failures certainly are not abysmal ones. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
            "Code 8 never really grabbed me, though I managed to watch it all the way through. Perhaps I am an outlier viewer, but I would have liked to see more time spent on why society lowered the status of the super-powered people to practically second class citizens. To me that might have been more compelling viewing than the details of Connor\u2019s descent into crime or his mother\u2019s rather stereotypical declining health. But within its narrow plot and limited number of interesting characters, it may have been less than great, but it was better than mediocre.",
            "Robbie Amell is undoubtedly a good-looking man, but that really does not forgive the fact that as an actor, he is really dead behind the eyes. The concept here is quite interesting - ordinary people have superpowers and are all still pretty much persecuted by the authorities. Amell is down on his luck and has a sick mother so, to pay for her extortionately expensive treatment, he seeks work casually - and soon falls in with the wrong company where he uses his powers (he can generate and focus electricity) to further their petty, but increasingly ambitious criminal activities. This gets him caught up between a drug-smuggling gang and with the pursuing police. Cousin Stephen discards his bow and arrow for this film, instead heading the druggie gang that will betray everyone/anyone as soon as look at them. The dialogue and pace of the film - there are some decent action scenes - keep it moving quite well, and the visual effects do their job - but the acting is just bland and the story an amalgam of B-grade X-men themes.",
            "Code 8 is X-Men minus the budget and the A-list cast, and that's the good news. Unfortunately, the movie suffers more, not when it deviates from, but when it copies Marvel's mutants. Code 8 is set in a world where 4% of the population are born with various supernatural abilities, but instead of being rich and famous, they face discrimination, live in poverty, and often turn to crime.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, Code 8 is an allegory about illegal immigrants in the US \u2013 the image of day laborers waiting for a van to take them to work is unmistakable, because we have seen it in other, better films (e.g., El Norte). There is also the matter of an addictive narcotic called Psyke manufactured from the cerebrospinal fluid of the People with Power (doesn't quite have the same ring as X-Men, does it?); a drug literally made by and for them.\r\n\r\nAddressing that some immigrants are forced to smuggle and sell drugs while others turn to alcohol and other drugs to cope with depression and anxiety is one of the things that Code 8 does well. The problem is that the movie doesn't seem to understand that illegal immigrants do these things because they are powerless. If Mexicans entering the United States illegally had the kind of power that Code 8 characters have, Los Angeles would have been returned to Mexico a long time ago.\r\n\r\nConnor and his similarly 'empowered' peers are oppressed because they want to be; what prison could contain them? I estimate that four \u201cPeople with Powers\u201d could reasonably demand that the President \u201ckneel to Zod\u201d within a week at most.\r\n\r\nWe know where illegal immigrants come from; of places where, to put it in the terms of the United States Declaration of Independence, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are nothing short of impossible (otherwise they'd stay put). Conversely, establishing the origin of the protagonists' powers in Code 8 is not as simple.\r\n\r\nLike those of the X-Men, these powers are unexplained \u2013 and unexplainable \u2013, and include the usual for a superhero (manipulation of electricity, superhuman strength), as well as, for lack of a better term, magic (telepathy, telekinesis) and finally, as Jules Winnfield would say, \"miracles according to Hoyle\" (healing the sick). Consider this: Sutcliffe's main lackey is bulletproof. Bulletproof! How does one even go about becoming bulletproof?\r\n\r\nCode 8 is a very imaginative movie (my favorite part is the Guardians, robot cops that drop from drones), but it has absolutely zero curiosity about its own characters. Where do their powers come from? How do they work? And why don't they use them on a larger scale? These are all questions that Code 8 doesn't answer because it doesn't even bother to ask them.",
            "Good use of budget. Interesting enough. Good ideas. I watched it because I thought I had to because Code 8 part two was out as well. I probably wouldn't have watched it without that. I'm glad I watched it."

            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/antlers-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Antlers is a cleverly shot, character-driven horror story with effective jumpscares and a captivating narrative that ultimately fails to reach its true potential.\r\n\r\nWith the help of experienced producers, Scott Cooper is able to generate a rich atmosphere and offer an intriguing monster, blending practical effects with minimal CGI perfectly, despite the low budget.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by gorgeous cinematography, Keri Russell leads an interesting storyline focused on her traumatic past, but it ends up far too underdeveloped. The main plot features more generic plot points and a somewhat underwhelming yet visually satisfying ending.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice watch, but one that I probably won't come back to.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
            "For the first half hour, this isn't that bad. A couple of men stripping an old mine hear some curious noises, next thing we are in a school with a young \"Lucas\" (Jeremy T. Thomas) seemingly distracted, a little dishevelled and only when his teacher \"Julia\" (Keri Russell) decides to investigate, do we realise that what came out of that mine was a hell of a lot more rapacious than what went into it... Sadly, though, the rest of it all quickly becomes a bit too routine and the ending though quite well built up, is really a bit too predicable, brief and flat. The \"monster\" is seriously under-used by director Scott Cooper. A lot is left to our imagination, and to an extent that works - but unfortunately, regular fans of this genre will probably have far gorier fantasies that those we are eventually offered here. It's not a terrible film, it is decently paced and the young \"Lucas\" holds it together quite well, but sadly it offers very little for us (or the beastie) to get our teeth into.",
            "Good story, good cast. It's enjoyable.\r\n\r\n<em>'Antlers'</em> sets the right tone throughout and delivers in serving up a satisfactorily creepy flick. Keri Russell, Jesse Plemons and youngster Jeremy T. Thomas all give strong performances, they make for an interesting trifecta to watch - even if they aren't as fully fleshed out ss they could've been.\r\n\r\nThe horror aspects are done really well, as expected with Guillermo del Toro involved behind the scenes along with director Scott Cooper & Co. I also love films that make the locations come alive, where the place feels lived in and gritty, and this passes that particularly test with flying colours in my eyes.\r\n\r\nAs usual with the genre, a follow-up is seemingly set at the end - which I'd be up for, sure, though do feel like this being a one-and-done would fit better - but we'll see.",
            "Antlers was a pretty big disappointment. The acting was lackluster, Keri Russell did okay, but I felt that Jesse Plemons was going through the motions delivering a poor performance. For a horror movie, this did not really feel scary at all. There is some cool characters designs during the transformation but the creature was pretty bad due to the heavy use of CGI. For a rated R film, there was not a lot of gore. I felt a lot of the kills were cut short or done off camera. This works when tension is built, but it wasn't and the payoff fell short. The story was generic and very predictable, character decisions were incredibly dumb in order to progress the plot. Combine all those issues with poor pacing and you get a tough movie to watch.\r\n\r\nScore: 38%\r\nVerdict: Poor",
            "Cliched and not at all scary. And I scare easily!!\r\nPredictable at every turn. I wasn't expecting much going in (based on its score) and my expectations were met. ;-)"

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never seen a movie from Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, but Pieces of a Woman started getting the usual awards buzz that comes with this time of the year. Once Netflix grabbed the distribution rights, it was just a matter of time until I got the chance to watch yet another Oscar-bait. I didn\u2019t really think about it nor created any sort of expectations besides hoping it would be good. Vanessa Kirby (Mission: Impossible - Fallout, Hobbs & Shaw) and Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy) are the protagonists of a story that will connect with many people around the world, especially couples who went through the same situation. I\u2019ll write it straight away: it\u2019s undoubtedly one of the best films I\u2019ve seen this past year.\r\n\r\nHow does it stand in comparison with the other marvelous movies? I\u2019ll have to think about it when organizing my Top10, but Pieces of a Woman possesses the best opening act I\u2019ve seen in quite a long time. For thirty full minutes (even before the title card shows up), an entire birth scene is delivered through excruciatingly long, uninterrupted takes, which ultimately make the whole sequence feel like a phenomenal oner. Technically, the entire film is brilliantly directed by Mundrucz\u00f3, who takes advantage of the superb cinematography from Benjamin Loeb and Howard Shore\u2019s beautiful score to offer the viewer an emotionally powerful viewing experience.\r\n\r\nAs fantastic as the technical attributes may be, Kata W\u00e9ber\u2019s exceptionally well-written, detailed screenplay is really elevated by the incredible cast, notably its leads. Without the shadow of a doubt, Vanessa Kirby gives her career-best performance, demonstrating an emotional range I genuinely believed she didn\u2019t have. Martha\u2019s arc ends up being a tad predictable and formulaic as some other characters\u2019 arcs and portions of the narrative, but I never felt less invested in the story due to that. In fact, I can\u2019t remember the last movie that brought tears to my eyes before the end of the first act, which serves as a statement of the film\u2019s realism and authenticity.\r\n\r\nShia LaBeouf might have also delivered his best interpretation ever, even though I truly love a couple of his past displays. Once again, the actor brings his A-game, demonstrating the talented acting skills that make him one of the most underrated actors working today, in my opinion. A particular aspect of Sean\u2019s arc left me a bit dubious of its necessity and/or importance to the narrative, but just like Kirby\u2019s character, I was always interested in their path. Molly Parker is also excellent as the midwife involved in the tragedy, while Ellen Burstyn portrays Martha\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, leaving me deeply surprised by her outstanding performance. 88 years old\u2026 Magnificent.\r\n\r\nDespite the highly expected developments and respective conclusions, the ending shares a touching revelation involving a particular trait from Kirby\u2019s character that hit me really hard. The best aspect of the entire movie has a negative side effect, though. After such a mesmerizing, powerful, shocking first act, the rest of the film never quite reaches the same level of investment and immersiveness that the initial thirty minutes are packed with. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still a remarkably captivating narrative, filled with significant messages of forgiveness, acceptance, fairness, and another take on the \u201cmoving on\u201d matter.\r\n\r\nIt will be extremely hard to watch for many people, but it\u2019s that realistic environment that left me speechless and surprisingly emotional right from the get-go. It might not be a movie that I\u2019ll rewatch countless times or even recommend to every single reader. Nevertheless, Pieces of a Woman carries an undeniably impactful story that tons of viewers will share a deep connection with, which every filmmaker tries hard to accomplish. Ultimately, concerning my Top10, it will come down to how much I value its immense quality vs. its low replay value.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Pieces of a Woman becomes a worthy awards contender, holding one of the best opening acts of the last few years. With astonishing direction from Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, the first thirty minutes are packed with extreme levels of anxiety and stress due to the emotionally shocking birth sequence, which is played out through excruciatingly long takes. Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf deliver their career-best performances, handling extensive monologues effortlessly, but it\u2019s the former who leaves me mind-blowed at her emotional range, which induced tears in my eyes even before the title card. Kata W\u00e9ber\u2019s exceptional screenplay is brought to life in a remarkably authentic, immersive manner, leaving me incredibly captivated by its characters, despite the formulaic and predictable arcs. Huge praise to Howard Shore\u2019s wonderful score, and Benjamin Loeb\u2019s terrific camera work, as well as Molly Parker and Ellen Burstyn\u2019s excellent displays. I highly recommend it to anyone who\u2019d love to watch an emotionally investing story with phenomenal acting but be advised: it can extremely hard to watch at times.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

They\u2019re so bad that Netflix has taken the man\u2019s name off most ads for the film and, especially considering the subject matter, it seems appropriate. LaBeouf gives an absolutely heartbreaking performance, but the allegations surrounding the actor make some of the material feel very upsetting (in particular, a scene where LaBeouf\u2019s character tries to force unwanted sex on his partner). But to dismiss this film would be unfair to the those who worked so hard both in front of and behind the camera.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and her partner Sean (LaBeouf) over the course of a year, set off by the new mother\u2019s home birth that ends in an unthinkable tragedy at the hands of a flustered midwife (Molly Parker). The grief begins to overwhelm the young couple, who are coping in very different ways. The first part of the movie highlights the deep love between the two but as the months tick on, their relationship become more fractured. Making things worse is Martha\u2019s domineering mother Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), who never liked Sean and sees her daughter as a failure.\r\n\r\nDirector Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3 has fashioned a gripping portrait of loss and grief that rests firmly on Kirby\u2019s shoulders. She gives a raw, physical and emotional performance that is truly outstanding. She and Burstyn create a realistic family dynamic which finally explodes when Martha and Elizabeth have a tense standoff over dinner. Mom wants her daughter to deal with the tragedy head-on instead of continuing to bury the pain. It\u2019s one of the strongest scenes in the film, and the two actors make it unforgettable.\r\n\r\nThe film has a melancholy atmosphere and tone that complements the subject matter. Everything is increasingly bleak and drab as Martha and Sean continue to make a series of bad-to-worse decisions and behaviors that eventually destroy their lives together. They deal with grief in varying ways. She bottles her sadness inside while he lashes out with increased aggression. That\u2019s part of what makes this story such a personal journey and makes it feel achingly authentic.\r\n\r\nDespite its flaws (including a lousy ending and numerous metaphors about building bridges and growing apples), \u201cPieces of a Woman\u201d doesn\u2019t shy away from presenting an unflinching look at deeply wounded humans who are devastated by grief. It\u2019s a tough film to watch, but it\u2019s an effective, intimate look at bereavement, agony, and a pain that no one could possibly heal.",
            "I totally get why this film has so many award nominations. The film deals with a difficult, very real, subject - how the loss of a child affects the relationships of those around him/her.

John Saxon plays the local detective.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlack Christmas\u201d (1974) obviously influenced \u201cHalloween\u201d (1978), e.g. the closet scene, but was influenced itself by psycho slasher flicks like \u201cPsycho\u201d (1960), \u201cDementia 13\u201d (1963) and \u201cSilent Night, Bloody Night\u201d (1972).\r\n\r\nHonestly, the 2006 remake has a more absorbing story which, to me, is the best indicator of a quality movie. This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting. \r\n\r\nBut I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-",
            "Black Christmas is what happens when a director decides to make a slasher but also decides to make a good movie. \r\n\r\nEach character has a purpose. By that, I don't mean simply to drive the plot along. Each character is a person, and they each have their own unique personalities and motivations. Barb isn't just the drunk and morally abrasive stereotype; she's driven by her jealousy and likely by issues from her childhood. Each character feels about as deep as her, at the least. \r\n\r\nThe only character who isn't fully explained is Billy, and that's for the best. Billy isn't a character we want explained, and it only drives the horror deeper that he isn't. \r\n\r\nThis should be on every horror fan's Christmas playlist.",
            "One of only two films in my adult life to have been in any way involved in giving me a sense of genuine fear.\r\n\r\n_Final rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._",
            "Black Christmas decorates traditional festivities with blood, suffocation and disturbing phone calls. Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! And have a slashin\u2019 good time! The slasher sub-genre was most proficient during the mid-to-late 70s, with \u2018Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u2019, \u2018Halloween\u2019 and a plethora of spicy Argento features to add a worldly aesthetic. However, one film that innovated the tropes and traits commonly found in the aforementioned titles, was Bob Clark\u2019s Black Christmas. A horror \u201cslasher\u201d (if you can classify it as that...) where an anonymous serial killer remains secluded in a sorority house, gradually picking off the girls one by one. Just in time for Santa to come down that warmly lit chimney and deliver them coffins wrapped up in cute little bows.\r\n\r\nTo say that Black Christmas was revolutionary and a blooded sprout for the blossoming sub-genre to come, would be an understatement. A nameless unknown killer that exhumes mental instability? Check. An expendable cast of characters that stupidly investigate ominous sounds by themselves? Check. Excruciating tension with every camera movement? Absolutely! Surprisingly, now that I\u2019ve witnessed various films during the conception of a horror movement, it\u2019s incredibly easy to see how influential Black Christmas is. Not for its innovative concept, as other simpler thrillers utilise slashing techniques with efficiency (\u2018Psycho\u2019), but rather for its technical proficiency.\r\n\r\nClark\u2019s direction, whilst unpolished, is solid throughout. Taut camera pans to explore the darkened hallways of the sorority house. Minimal sound editing to heighten the suspense. Excellent use of shadows to illustrate the antagonist\u2019s anonymity. Sublime POV perspective to place the viewer in the shoes of the killer. And a ramped up conclusive act that will have anyone watching perched on the edge of their seats eagerly anticipating to unwrap the plot twist, even if that narrative turn was predictable from the offset. The camera can be visible on specific occasions, mostly through reflections in picture frames as it glides through hallways. Emphasising that unrefined quality of Clark\u2019s novice-like direction. It does give the feature some flavour, perhaps not the jolly festivities one was yearning for. More egg nog than champagne.\r\n\r\nYet what really injected some holiday spirit into the story, were the characters. Uniquely all acquiring a distinguishable personality that made them different and relatable. The shady drunk friend or the intellectual gal who has all the common sense (that is until she goes wandering by herself...!). The point is, they were all memorable, and that\u2019s a rare achievement in slashers. The second act, where the campus police become involved, does stagnate the overall pace with minimal storytelling momentum. Fortunately the third act immediately picks it back up for an explosive bauble of...slashing.\r\n\r\nSo despite the lack of actual slashing, overall unrefined quality and inconsistent pacing, it\u2019s an extremely enjoyable horror flick that takes a gentle holiday season and turns it into a crazy murder-sesh. Perhaps my new annual Christmas film? We\u2019ll see...! I am sadistic after all!",
            "I suppose a sorority can be used to host a multitude of characters, so that's what Bob Clark does here as he puts four quite different girls into an house supervised by the likably dypso \"Mrs. Mac\" (Marian Waldman). The house has, for ages now, being getting crank calls from a guy they call the \"moaner\". Some get upset by his behaviour, others laugh it off but when one of their number \"Clare\" (Lynne Griffin) disappears and the police are called in by her boyfriend \"Chris\" (Art Hindle), the sense of menace ratchets up a notch. As we get to know these characters, there are quite a few suspects and quite a few decent reasons why we might want to bump them all off. \"Jess\" (Olivia Hussey) is expecting a child with wayward boyfriend \"Pete\" (Keir Dullea) only he doesn't know it yet; give-as-good-as-you-get \"Barb\" (Margot Kidder) quite likes to goad their would-be tormentor (\"Billy\") - much to his obvious chagrin. More menacing yet is the increasingly detailed knowledge contained in the calls. \"Billy\" is spookily well informed. Could he be one of them? I'm not too sure what this has to have to do with Christmas, to be honest. It's just another typical slasher set amongst a student fraternity that gives everyone an opportunity to scream and make some shockingly poor under-pressure decisions. Neither the acting nor the writing stand out but the photography is quite effective at creating and sustaining a modest sense of peril as our killer nears goal. It's not really very scary, indeed time hasn't been to kind to it at all - but it's watchable if you like the genre and have taken a drink or two."

            "Are politicians fundamentally just vampires, in disguise?\r\n\r\nEl Conde crafts a clever tale that weaves the life of the vampire, with that of the politician. \r\n\r\nIt draws on two, well known, right wing, political figures, from Chilean and UK politics. The notorious Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet and the iron lady of UK politics, Margaret Thatcher. \r\n\r\nThis is a surreal, highly watchable experience, that's at times brutal, and visually, compellingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nIts not perfect. Its starts and ends convincingly, cleverly drawing together the threads of the story. What happens in between, can come across, as a little too diffuse and disordered, at times, to really represent anything contextually cohesive.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this is a highly original, stimulating piece of film noir, that stays with you, long after the closing credits. Its ambition can and does outshine it achievements. That said, what it does achieve, is well worth your time.",
            "Fusing cinematic genres can be tricky, especially if the mix doesn\u2019t mesh. But the latest from writer-director Pablo Larra\u00edn successfully pulls off a brilliantly original blend and does so just about perfectly. This metaphorical account of the life of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet (1915-2006) (Jaime Vadell) portrays the onetime-strongman as a vampire a la Dracula (hence the title and the character\u2019s nickname, \u201cthe Count\u201d), shot in the style of F.W. Murnau\u2019s black-and-white silent film classic, \u201cNosferatu\u201d (1922). The story charts the immortal\u2019s life from his birth as orphaned royalist Claude Pinoche in late 18th Century France through the many military campaigns in which he fought to put down radical rebellions before finally rising to power as the right-wing dictator of Chile through the 1973 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of left-wing President Salvador Allende. But much of the narrative actually follows Pinochet in the years after he was himself out of office, living a life in seclusion after faking his death. It\u2019s a time when he is being stalked by various parties seeking to get their hands on his illegally amassed fortune, including his wife (Gloria M\u00fcnchmeyer), his longtime butler (Alfredo Castro), a nun/exorcist posing as an accountant auditing his assets (Paula Luchsinger) and his five adult children. And, ironically, as all of this is transpiring, Pinochet himself is in the throes of ennui, trying to make up his mind about whether or not he wants to go on living. Many story threads emerge and become intertwined, satirically invoking wry observations about despotism, greed, power, lust, immortality and religion. On top of all this, there\u2019s an articulate, faceless narrator with a pronounced British accent who tells the tale and makes an unexpected appearance late in the film, taking things in an entirely new direction with deliciously twisted plot developments. Add to all this the film\u2019s stunningly gorgeous monochrome cinematography, superb production design, fine performances and positively sparkling screenplay, along with just enough restrained campiness in the dialogue and special effects to make viewers giggle with delight without becoming silly, and you\u2019ve got one finely crafted production, perfectly integrated and nicely balanced. Admittedly, the pacing drags a smidge late in the second act, but that\u2019s easily dismissed considering how well everything else works together. Also, the film is quite graphic in a number of sequences, so squeamish and sensitive viewers would be wise to avoid this one. But, if you\u2019re not faint of heart and have an appetite for the macabre, give this Netflix exclusive a look. Director Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s pictures keep getting better and better with every outing, and this is the latest in a string of releases that have firmly established him as one of the finest auteurs in the business these days. Tune in and see for yourself.",
            "The real-world history of Pinochet et al should be common knowledge. Add the vampire aspect in, and you've got a starting point for an interesting story.\r\n\r\nThere was potential in the concept, but the result here doesn't go beyond a comedy show skit - with two hours runtime.\r\n\r\nThe actors are given little to work with, so despite competence and good efforts, half the characters are and stay clich\u00e9d.\r\nWhat saves it from being a complete waste of time is the development of Vampire relationships; especially the modernised Renfield is well done.\r\n\r\nBut what's with the decrepit barracks which turn out to be some kind of a farm? A set of one-story buildings having secret passages and dungeons doesn't make sense; if there was a specific story or cultural idea behind this, it was neither shown nor told.\r\n\r\nThere's award nominations for the visuals; they must've seen a different movie. What I've seen is on a level many YT content creators achieve or surpass. Hiding the cheapness of visual effects under a brownish-dirt-grey tone for all of the movie is an trick that seldom works.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's cherished as a confirmation film, a thigh-slapping, \"that's what I say\"? That would be clumsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict: Can't recommend. Wish I hadn't wasted about two hours of lifetime on watching it."

            "Liberal snooty types lashing out at conservative cronies and their right-wing leanings should have made for some enjoyably edgy satire, but 'The Hunt' is merely a by-the-numbers comedy-horror-suspense thriller that has a few punchy moments. But, if production company Blumhouse wants to remake a bunch of 90s Jean-Claude Van Damme action movies with Betty Gilpin in the lead role, I think I'd be down with that. I'd watch them, not in the theatres obviously, but late at night after a few beers.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-hunt-blunt-lazy-and-undeserving-of-controversy",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know, I'm from Portugal. Why does this matter? Well, The Hunt was delayed after a massive shooting in the USA, and since the movies' themes are extremely sensitive, the producers decided to postpone the film. At the time, I felt frustrated that, once again, movies have to suffer from real-life situations. Going to the theater is supposed to be an \"out of this world\" experience. The audience is transported into a fictional place where real-world problems can be forgotten for a couple of hours. So, I never handled these constant controversies surrounding films very well...\r\n\r\nWith that said, I believe The Hunt not only benefited from that delay, but its satirical story has even more impact now. There's no way around this. Craig Zobel's movie is meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years. I know it's a pretty basic analogy, but it's just like a dark humor standup show. If you don't have any issues with jokes about topics like racism, stereotypes, immigration, refugees, religion, politics, and every sensitive theme that your mind can imagine, then you'll find The Hunt a brilliant allegory of society's most extreme people. If you do have problems with this type of comedy, then stay away from this movie because Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out!\r\n\r\nWhen I write that every remotely sensitive taboo subject or activity is unrestrainedly addressed, I mean EVERY SINGLE theme. This is a narrative completely packed with extreme, over-the-top cliches and stereotypes of both right and left political sides. At first glance, The Hunters feel like the \"bad guys\", in the sense that they're hunting innocent people for pure pleasure. Once the audience understands the reasons behind the selection of the people being hunted, one small but tremendously effective thought enters everyone's mind: \"you know what... the world would actually be a better place without this kind of people\".\r\n\r\nSuddenly, not a single character is worth caring about. To clarify, I don't mean \"caring about\" in the common, emotional way. No character is written with the purpose of making the audience worry about it. In fact, almost every character (maybe except Betty Gilpin's) is a despicable human being. Their view of the world is clouded by ideologically outdated mentalities. I love how the screenwriters use each character to represent a particular type of ... extreme personality, let's call it that. One of the best compliments I can give the film is that it didn't pick a side. Everyone gets blasted with jokes.\r\n\r\nIt's a dark yet hilarious satire of today's society with a special focus on the close-minded people that go online to try and spread their conspiracy theories and immoral beliefs. Everything that I just wrote so far resembles the movie's impact on the viewer: either you're okay with this type of screenplay and you'll be incredibly entertained; or you'll get extremely triggered by all this. It's one of those films that will end up on a bunch of \"Worst Movies of 2020\" lists simply due to its narrative's nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story isn't the only aspect that can make people give up on watching this movie. The actual hunt is as over-the-top as everything else. There's blood everywhere, ridiculously disgusting deaths, and absolutely no limits whatsoever in killing people in the most insanely entertaining way possible. Action-wise, The Hunt is better filmed than a lot of blockbusters. Beautiful wide shots when something (or someone) explodes, exceptional (and hilariously long) choreography for the \"final fight\", and excellent editing overall. It's genuinely a well-made, well-produced, and well-filmed movie. The score is also pretty cool.\r\n\r\nObviously, it's one of those films that's easy to pinpoint flaws. Every single paragraph that I wrote above can be interpreted as some of the worst aspects of the entire movie, depending on each person's perspective. In my opinion, I think the ending would have benefited from a more serious tone, but at the same time, it would probably clash with the widespread satirical one, so it's an inevitably difficult ending to completely get right. The cast is a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to each actor's performance (some are very bland), but Betty Gilpin delivers an outstanding display and seamlessly carries the whole film. Finally, there's a small part of the movie that involves military characters who don't belong to either side of The Hunt, and that portion didn't really work for me.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Hunt is a brilliantly dark satire on today's political views of the world. It's meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years, and it undoubtedly succeeds in its mission. Just like dark humor, either you're okay with it, or you're not. If you can't take a joke about the most extremely sensitive taboo themes (and I mean ALL of them), then stay away from this movie or you'll be triggered for a whole week. However, if you can see the fun side of this type of comedy, The Hunt is the most entertaining, witty, hilarious, bloody, over-the-top action thriller you'll see for a long time. Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out, and they don't forget to approach a single topic. It's a well-made film all-around: well-written, well-produced, and well-filmed. A few minor issues regarding its ending and a small subplot don't diminish Craig Zobel's exceptionally captivating concept and Betty Gilpin's compelling performance. I definitely recommend it depending on how much you enjoy dark humor.\r\n\r\nPS: everyone knows the tale about the rabbit and the turtle, right? How the rabbit races the turtle, and all that? Well, The Hunt's version of that story just became my all-time favorite.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "> Review From **_Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nGaining its momentum back in mid 2019, The Hunt stirred up quite a bit of controversy prior to its initial release, branding it too brutal for release due to the mass shootings in Ohio, Texas last summer. This Blumhouse picture was later rescheduled, and was at one point never to see the light of day, which would have been a crushing blow knowing how relevant this actually turned out to be. Luckily for us, Blumhouse soon caught on and realised movies like The Hunt are exactly what our cruel audience\u2019s need right now, something with a sharp satirical bite with a gut-punching narrative reflective of modern society. Welcome to my favourite horror movie of the past few years.\r\n\r\nImagine a Twitter thread was made into a movie, this is The Hunt. What we have here is a film that functions on the confliction that exists in the real-world between liberals and conservatives, as they take chunks out of each other when discussing politics online, spilling blood on each side as opinions and views are torn to shit by the opposing party. What is depicted is literal death and carnage, which is representative of how the different identities and political views that are one person's beliefs, but another\u2019s infuriating joke.\r\nImage result for the hunt 2020 film\r\nThe beauty here (which is addressed as a massive concern to most reviewers) is the lack of depth to these characters within The Hunt, and to their lifestyle choices and political standpoints. What works best is that it never takes a stance when mocking both sides of the political spectrum, and allows us as an audience to identify which whatever our political views lead us to, even if one side is draped in murderous overtones. I admire how we are left to decide where we would stand, and if what is happening is something we can sympathise with. To most, what I\u2019m saying sounds ridiculous, but this lack of depth to these characters is very much reflective on the current state of our social media, having people who we know nothing about spreading their views which are toxic to half and relatable to others.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s that online fa\u00e7ade that is at play here, as we witness comments and statements daily that tear down others, ruin people\u2019s professional statuses or simply to spread offensive and insensitive comments online to troll others. This is the world we live in, and the characters in The Hunt exist within our real world. The characters within this may not be fleshed out, but to the online profiles with nothing but a name, a picture and a flurry of controversial tweets neither are they, and that certainly looks like modern day humanity to me.\r\n\r\nMuch of The Hunt\u2019s satirical sting comes from its reliance on our current climate and political correctness, which leans on its accurate depiction of society to get its laughs in when it can. It\u2019s understandable that this particular sense of humour might to a little too one-note for some, but it firmly has its own tongue planted in its cheek when openly mocking our current way of thinking, juxtaposing these characters with opposing mind-sets to create a genuinely clever and on-the-nose depiction on humanity\u2019s contemporary views. Aside from the intelligent links to modern society, it\u2019s also really enjoyable and highly entertaining when utilised to its full potential. One could be offended by some of the humour here, but when the film itself jokes on our own generation of snowflakes, it begs the question if The Hunt is pointing the finger at you, and calling you out for being said snowflake. It all really works for me on a sharply pungent level, one that had me tickled pink until the final credits. The Hunt ultimately holds up a darkly comedic mirror up to the political divisions in a way that hasn\u2019t been explored to this stature.\r\nImage result for the hunt 2020\r\nThe action here is outstanding, with the violence being the appropriate level of over the top to match its exuberant premise. Betty Giplin is undeniably outstanding as she delivers a powerhouse of a performance in her portrayal of Crystal, a tough as nails heroine who easily establishes herself in the ranks next to such genre greats as Erin from You\u2019re Next and Alien\u2019s Ripley. Her level of badass is contagiously ferocious, making every scene she\u2019s in an absolute blast to witness. Each fight scene is crafted brilliantly, looking seamlessly effortless with its high-energy intensity, most notably when we reach our final act in which our Million Dollar Baby Hillary Swank comes head-to-head with Giplin, which can only be described as one of the most entertaining fight scenes in recent horror memory.\r\n\r\nNothing is ever fully dripping in suspense, but you soon realise it doesn\u2019t need to be when you\u2019re watching enigmatic fight scenes that are as vicious as they are diverting. The film also works its best when it plays at its most unexpected, knocking familiar faces off like Drew Barrymore in Scream level of unexpected in ways so gleefully gory it will have you laughing with sheer shock. The Hunt may split audiences right down the middle, but there is one thing that is universal, and that\u2019s that Betty Giplin\u2019s Crystal is already this decades best Final Girl.\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nProving to be one of the strongest contemporary social and political horror movies in recent memory, The Hunt is a lean, mean, fighting machine that is as sharply satirical as it is viciously violent. Make room for Betty Giplin, our new final girl is in town.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",
            "Irony of ironies that this movie's release got pulled due to Trump's shitfit despite never having seen it, when a not insubstantial part of _The Hunt_ is about the left's propensity for sparking outrage without having the whole story. The reality is, the nothing _The Hunt_ has to say is worth being outraged over. Betty Gilpin's great in it, because of course she is, intermittently there some pretty fun violence, and only **most** of the dialogue is incredibly awkward, but if you want any sort of consumable message, or witty repartee, don't be fooled by people on any end of any spectrum, saying that's something you can find here. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
            "It was... fine. Nothing really to write home about, but some decent kills and gore, plus true subverting expectations with the cast of characters killed off early on. Kind of peters out towards the end but overall it's worth a rental but one could wait until it's available for free as part of a streaming service. **3.5/5**",
            "I knew this film was going to be something different but I didn\u2019t read anything about the film before I started watching it. And this is my absolute recommendation to anybody who is thinking of watching this film. Don\u2019t read anything about it. Just watch it. It is different, obscure, unusual, political, weird and overall awesome!\r\n\r\nWould I watch it again? Yes! Would I make my friends watch it? Absolutely!",
            "Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best, if weirdly refreshing movies I've seen in quite some time.  I'm a sucker for a good survival movie, and this is an \"elites hunt people for sport\" trope mixed with a good mystery plot if there ever was one.  The story structure alone is worth the watch as it essentially runs 3 (-4) sequential stories to tell one overall story while telling you about the story structure.  Some movies clearly put a lot of effort into keeping you on your toes, this movie just does it.\r\n\r\nNot only is the gunfighting immaculate, but the combat action sequences are amazing.  Betty Gilpin steals the show every time she's on screen, and I would normally say she's the one that carries the movie, but the movie is good enough that even though she's over the top great, I can't say the movie needs her to carry it.\r\n\r\nThere is an investigative aspect of the movie that is very intriguing, but that is given in the \"why are they doing this to us\" of it all, but unless the villains give an \"evil speech\", then it should be expected.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy human vs human survival situations, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this one.",

            "Basically, there are a ton of 1 star reviews on IMDb complaining that it makes the left look bad... despite, you know, things like Antifa and their belief that a red hat means they gt to physically assault people.\r\n\r\nSo I am going to give it 10 stars... because my wife had a milk shake thrown at her for being a \"race traitor\" and, on our way back from work we got egged (along with everyone else at a red light) in an attempt to convince us to support impeachment.\r\n\r\nAnd, because of that I think that this works as a satire about that attitude that having a different opinion means they have the right to act violently, by taking that attitude to an extreme.\r\n\r\nAnd when reviewers write sentences like \"insipid portrayals of both the elite and the deplorables\" it only serves to reinforce the attitude that the film is parodying, that attitude that they are \"elite\" elevated above all others, and those in the out group are dehumanized as \"deplorable.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the vast majority of the 1 star reviews are written with a vocabulary that so perfectly echoes the people that the film is a satire of that it is almost impossible not to see the brilliance here.\r\n\r\n\"Elite\" and \"deplorable\" a part of me thinks that they realize that they are the subject of satire in this film... but can't seem to avoid acting exactly like the people that are being mocked here.\r\n\r\nSo, congratulations, language of the negative reviews alone make this a brilliant satire."

            "The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a \"better\" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.\r\n\r\nThe film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic \"fourth act\" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "For a film that\u2019s laser-focused on the human body, it\u2019s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. \r\n\r\nEggs are the \u2018giver of life\u2019, right? They\u2019re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked \u2013 not by a fork, but a syringe.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival.\r\n\r\nTo call the film \u2018bold\u2019 is a weapons-grade understatement. It\u2019s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn\u2019t laugh, you\u2019d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.\r\n\r\nHere's our deep dive for good.film: https://good.film/guide/holy-sh-t-the-substance-is-a-weapons-grade-takedown-of-the-male-gaze",
            "Demi Moore's performance in The Substance is so potent that it's hard to tell what's more intoxicating; her inevitable Best Actress win or Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp screenplay that's already got the Oscar in the bag.",
            "There\u2019s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film\u2019s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that\u2019s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members\u2019 patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn\u2019t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering \u201cTitane\u201d (2021). It also shamelessly \u201cborrows\u201d elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from \u201cThe Shining\u201d (1980) and \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d (1974), costume designs from the \u201cHunger Games\u201d franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like \u201cVertigo\u201d (1958). Then there\u2019s the picture\u2019s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture\u2019s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how \u201cThe Substance\u201d captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I\u2019m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than \u201csubstance.\u201d",
            "This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier \"Reality+\" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. \"Elisabeth\" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss \"Harvey\" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best \"Jekyll and Hyde\" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character \"Sue\" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is \"borrowed\" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing \"Harvey\" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised \"Elisabeth\" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled \"beauty\" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.",
            "Certainly an experience!\r\n\r\n<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!\r\n\r\nI think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!\r\n\r\nIf you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture. I may need a lie-down though.",
            "I love French comedic films, and this one is no different. Coralie Fargeat crafted a seemingly simple story on the subject of Hollywood's obsession with youth and beauty, and then directed it right into the status of cult, horror, midnight, grade B (the good kind) movie genre. Brilliant!\r\n\r\nWhile on the face, this movie is about aging out of Hollywood's graces, the script is also laced with interesting subplots: having a proxy that ages for you a la Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, and the subject of shallow self-hate and self-love, along with that \"needy for applause\" character that so many actors have and must either learn to deal, or fail at life.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore is nothing short of awesome here. Dennis Quaid and Margaret Qualley are right up there with her and Fargeat in playing over-the-top choices.",
            "**The Substance (2024)**\r\nA Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time\r\n\r\n\"The Substance\" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.\r\nThe film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.\r\nAt its core, \"The Substance\" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like \"Death Becomes Her\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.\r\nThe narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death\u2014being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.\r\n\r\n**Practical Effects and Gore**\r\nFrom the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love\u2014a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's \"The Fly,\" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.\r\n\r\n**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**\r\nThe color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.\r\n\r\n**Performances**\r\nDemi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.\r\n\r\n**Critique**\r\nWhile the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.\r\n\r\n**Engaging with the Hype**\r\n\"The Substance\" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Substance\" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like \"Gremlins,\" \"Frankenstein,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" and \"Carrie,\" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.\r\nDespite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation\u2014a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, \"The Substance\" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.\r\n\r\n**Extra Thoughts**\r\n- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?\r\n- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.\r\n- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.\r\n\r\n**Final Recommendation**\r\n\"The Substance\" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",
            "\"The Substance\" is something of a cinematic mash up. \r\n\r\nFirst off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of \"Death Becomes Her\". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. \r\n\r\nThe notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.\r\n\r\nThat said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. \r\n\r\nThis work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. \r\n\r\nIn summary, \"The Substance\" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. \r\n\r\nI will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",
            "A disaster. It's an insult to the illustrious careers of Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid, who both deserve far better.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses too heavily on the body of Margaret Qualley's character, Sue, at the expense of delivering a meaningful story or message. The gratuitous gore towards the end seems to be an attempt to align with current trends, but it falls flat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Coralie Fargeat failed to deliver a coherent message, making the movie a missed opportunity for everyone involved.",
            "I\u2019m into strange films, psychological elements, dramas, and gore, but this movie is complete garbage.",
            "Grotesque, diving into the pitfalls of progress and the human obsession with perfection. Visually, it\u2019s remarkable \u2014 its uncanny imagery often leaves you questioning whether you\u2019re thrilled or disturbed.\r\n\r\nHowever, while it\u2019s bold and at times deeply unsettling, it doesn\u2019t quite achieve that elusive \"perfectly balanced (as all things should be, cit.)\" quality.\r\nThe narrative occasionally stumbles, with gaps that detract from its overall impact.\r\nIt\u2019s thought-provoking but not groundbreaking \u2014 a film that\u2019s above average, yet just shy of excellence.\r\n\r\nAnd I like to imagine that the director somehow died during the making of the movie and was secretly replaced by Yoshihiro Nishimura."

            "Is there anyone on earth who doesn't like Christopher Nolan\u2019s films? Inception is one of his masterpieces. It\u2019s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as \u2018Memento\u2019, \u2018The dark knight\u2019, Prestige\u2019 and \u2018Interstellar\u2019. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the \u2018inception\u2019 of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\r\n\r\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don\u2019t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\r\n\r\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.",

Well if you really break this movie at it's core, it's about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.\r\n\r\nThe 'Grow Old Together' scene stuck with me the most.\r\n\r\nYou can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I'm also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nSeriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking \"Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie\". The ingredients are right there.",

Also some bland emotional displays overall. Other than these small issues it is as perfect as a movie can be made. Totally Amazing film when you are in the mood for an action movie.

The intricate plot weaves together elements of heist movies, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending science fiction, creating a narrative tapestry that is as complex as it is captivating.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Performances and Characters: A Dream Team</h2>\r\n  <p>DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance as the tormented Cobb, haunted by the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy, bring depth and nuance to their roles, each contributing significantly to the film's emotional core and intricate plot mechanics. Cotillard's portrayal of Mal is particularly noteworthy, embodying both allure and danger as a projection of Cobb's guilt-ridden subconscious. The ensemble cast's chemistry and individual performances elevate the film, grounding its high-concept premise in genuine human emotion and conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Visual Spectacle and Technical Mastery</h2>\r\n  <p>Nolan's vision is brought to life through stunning cinematography by Wally Pfister and groundbreaking visual effects. The film's most iconic scenes, such as the folding Paris cityscape and the zero-gravity hotel fight, are not merely eye candy but integral parts of the narrative. These visually arresting moments serve to illustrate the malleable nature of the dream world while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in cinema. Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding layers of tension and emotion to every scene. The technical prowess displayed in \"Inception\" sets a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a world that feels both fantastical and tangible.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Legacy and Impact: A Dream That Lingers</h2>\r\n  <p>Since its release, \"Inception\" has sparked countless discussions and debates, particularly regarding its ambiguous ending. This open-ended conclusion invites viewers to question the nature of reality and the power of perception, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll. The film's influence can be seen in subsequent movies that explore similar themes of reality versus illusion. \"Inception\" not only entertains but also challenges its audience, encouraging multiple viewings to fully grasp its complexity. It stands as a pinnacle of Nolan's filmography, showcasing his ability to blend high-concept ideas with emotional depth and spectacular action. In the landscape of modern cinema, \"Inception\" remains a towering achievement, a dream from which many viewers may never want to wake.</p>\r\n</article>"

            "I'm sorry, but who the fuck, with no promotional material, and with a name as generic as _The_ fuckin' _Ritual_, told this movie, it was allowed to be so good?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",
            "RELEASED IN 2017 and directed by David Bruckner, \"The Ritual\" is a psychological adventure/horror about four British dudes in their 30s who embark on a hike in remote northern Sweden wherein it slowly becomes evident that some THING is stalking them in the dark woods. Will any of them make it out alive? \r\n\r\nThis is basically a meshing of \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (1999) and \u201cOgre\u201d (2008), but without the tongue-in-cheekiness of the latter. There\u2019s also a little bit of \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d (1973/2006). Like \u201cBlair Witch\u201d the foul-mouthed protagonists become increasingly horrified in the foreboding forest and eventually turn on one another. But the sylvan cinematography is leagues superior due to the spectacular Romanian locations as opposed to the pedestrian film-work of \u201cBlair Witch\u201d in Maryland (which is understandable since the latter is a \u201cfound-footage\u201d flick).\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to give-away the creature, which isn\u2019t fully revealed until the last fifteen minutes, but it\u2019s basically a hybrid of the monsters in \u201cThe Relic\u201d (1997) and \u201cWendigo\u201d (2001), albeit bigger, and superior to both. The second half deviates from the book and people complain about it, but it\u2019s superior to the lame black metal cult of the book IMHO and you can\u2019t beat one potent sequence that smacks of hell-on-earth. There\u2019s also an intriguing element about achieving nigh-immortality at the price of submissive veneration. Despite these positives, the movie\u2019s a little uneventful and humdrum, plus it's lacking in the female department.                \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot entirely in Romania. WRITERS: Joe Barton wrote the script based on Adam Nevill\u2019s 2012 novel. CAST: The four protagonists are played by Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier and Sam Troughton. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",
            "The Ritual is a monster movie with psychological ambitions and seemingly a decent budget. The j\u00f6tunn monster is actually quite good and so are the cyclic re-enactments of the early on liquor store trauma. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is as bland as the title and relies too much on exotism of the deep Swedish forests. Sadly even that component gets watered out and the endgame cultists seem to be some recycled wiccans from Scotland rather than pre-christians of northern Scandinavia.",
            "David Bruckner's The Ritual is an atmospheric horror film that effectively combines psychological tension with a touch of the supernatural. The story follows four friends on a hiking trip in the Scandinavian wilderness, where they encounter not only the haunting landscape but also their own fears and regrets.\r\n\r\nWhat sets The Ritual apart is the authenticity of the characters and their relationships. The dialogue and interactions feel natural, and the bond between the friends comes across as genuine, with years of shared history subtly woven into their exchanges. This grounding in realism makes the escalating terror all the more impactful.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time building suspense, though some scenes linger longer than necessary, and certain dialogues feel repetitive. These moments, while noticeable, don\u2019t detract significantly from the overall experience. The latter part of the movie veers into unexpected territory, delivering an unsettling and imaginative climax that feels fresh in a genre often bound by convention.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is stunning, with the eerie forest serving as a character in its own right, amplifying the isolation and dread. The Ritual succeeds in blending human drama with horror, creating a story that's both haunting and deeply relatable. While not without minor flaws, it\u2019s a compelling watch for fans of atmospheric and character-driven horror.",
            "Has a great first half but really lets itself down after the monster makes its first appearance. Still a solid horror, definitely worth a watch but nothing to cry about. The first house sequence was really well done and genuinely scary 3/5"

            "Another forgettable Game of Ender/Hunger Games/Divergent clone.\r\n\r\nIn this case, to compensate that the main characters are often women, we just make the whole cast to be men.\r\n\r\nJust forget about this.",
            "It was a good movie as far as it goes -- resourceful characters deprived of both freedom and their memories manage to build a society and think their way out of their bondage.  The problem is that at the end, it simply stopped.  No dramatic reason for ending where it does, no resolution of \"why did the captors do this?\" .  Even in a series a movie ought to have a decent local climax -- for example,  Kat and Peeta winning the Hunger Games.",
            "One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a \u201cyoung adult\u201d movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:",

            "Amnesiac Dylan O'Brian emerges from a lift shaft in the ground to be found by a group of lads who've all been left to live a sort of subsistence existence inside a whopping great stone maze. A quick bout of wrestling with \"Gally\" (Will Poulter) reminds him that his name is \"Thomas\" but that still doesn't help him - or anyone else - with what he's doing here. Each day the great doors of the maze open up, but anyone who does try to make it out is never heard from again. The lads are completely clueless until a girl is sent amongst them, and she \"Teresa\" (Kaya Scodelario) might just have the answer as \"Thomas\" manages to galvanise a few of his pals to test the secrets of the maze. Can they escape, and if they do - what are they escaping too? Is it freedom or might it actually be worse? They do know that the maze is being patrolled by some menacing metal monsters so it's quite a dangerous leap of faith they must take - but it's either that or staying put. This is clearly part one of a franchise, so much of it is simply character establishment with some ground rules laid down for them and us. A reliable cast of associates help keep the film story and the characters develop well enough - though quite why Londoner Poulter had to have an American accent is anyone's guess. The Dashner novels upon which this is based follow a familiar line, but director Wes Ball tries to keep the film moving along quickly with plenty of moments of peril, acrobatics and using a star whom the camera likes and who energetically enters into the spirit of this adventure. It's enjoyable fayre - you'll never remember who was who afterwards, but these sort of franchises were all the rage in the mid-noughties, and this is perfectly watchable and occasionally exciting brain fodder.",
            "Re-watching The Maze Runner was a pleasant experience, and I still enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. The film's directing stands out, with a well-paced first act that successfully introduces us to the characters, the maze, and their unsettling situation. This setup provides a strong foundation for an exciting second act and a finale that leaves the audience with lingering questions, perfectly setting the stage for the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography deserves praise as well. A standout moment is the opening sequence: the close-up shots immerse us in the disoriented perspective of the protagonist, only to transition smoothly to a zoom-out that reveals the towering, closed walls of the maze. This visual storytelling continues throughout the movie, maintaining a consistent sense of scale and tension.\r\n\r\nThe acting is another strong point. Most of the cast delivers solid performances, creating believable connections and helping viewers grow attached to each character. Their chemistry and emotional delivery effectively add weight to the story's stakes.\r\n\r\nWhile the script is generally solid, it does feature a few clich\u00e9d jokes here and there, but these moments don't detract much from the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe Maze Runner is a well-executed film that combines strong direction, engaging visuals, and compelling performances. It builds a suspenseful and immersive world while keeping the audience eager for what comes next. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it."

In a shot he's looking all sad and bedraggled at the windows, next he's demolished the man's dinner and finally coaxed him from his comfortable flat to a new house that they share with the dog \"Odie\". His life is just one idyllic round of snoozing, eating and watching \"Catflix\" until he and \"Odie\" are kidnapped. Why? Well it's only when they are rescued by a caped hero - who turns out to be his dad \"Vic\", and we then are introduced to the criminal mastermind that is \"Jinx\" who has an axe to grind, that we start to get to the bottom things. She spent ages in the pound and is looking for her pint of milk! Now \"Garfield\", \"Odie\" and \"Vic\" have to come up with plan to rob a well defended dairy to settle scores. Even if they succeed, can they trust the duplicitous \"Jinx\" and her two sinister hench-creatures? It's an amiable enough adventure movie, this, with plenty of daft escapades for the cats, a menacing security officer and even an old lovelorn bull (\"Otto\") who's seen better days. I found the story reminded me a bit of the \"Wallace and Gromit\" kind of mishap-ridden narrative and though it's probably twenty minutes too long to sustain a film that doesn't seem to ever want to end, it's got the usual messages to team-playing, family and loyalty and has some quite witty one-liners now and again.",

But there's only real development between those two by the end, nobody else.\r\n\r\nAnd the casting is quite bad as well because none of the actors really sell me on their performance, just seems they're phoning it in. The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.\r\n\r\nHow can a Garfield movie truly be done? After seeing this I have little hope for Garfield movies in the future. But the idea of Garfield being in a movie is outlandish and quite hard to make a feasible plot without introducing lame characters. This franchise is hard to make acceptable for fans since it will never live up to what Garfield truly is. But to give us an hour and a half of our time with him for a outlandish, out of this world, story is enough regardless of how bad it might be, because it will never work out.",

            "The opening bars of \"Pure Imagination\" give us a clue as to what's coming next, and for the most part it's a strong testament to the engaging and charismatic man playing the eponymous chocolatier. He arrives is a town controlled by a chocolate cartel that is determined to use any means possible to ensure he can't fulfil his dream. That dream? Well ever since he was a child, he has wanted to make chocolate as well as his mother (Sally Hawkins). To do that, though, he needs a shop - and without a silver sovereign to his name that's not going to happen. It's winter, so his first order of business is somewhere to sleep. Luckily (?!?) \"Bleacher\" (Tom Davis) finds him on a cold bench and takes him to the welcoming arms of \"Mrs. Scrubbit\" (Olivia Colman) who offers him a bed for the night, though pretty soon he realises it's more of a bed in return for a life of indentured laundry servitude. Still, he's ingenious and he doesn't lose sight of his goal, so together with his fellow inmate \"Noodle\" (Calah Lane) and book-keeper \"Abacus Crunch\" (Jim Carter) they concoct a plan to addict the population to the young man's sweets whilst bringing down the evil trio of truffle terrorisers and ensuring \"Scrubbit\" and \"Bleacher' get their comeuppance too!. Meantime \"Wonka\" has other problem. Someone is pinching his product! An elaborate trap and a large jar introduce us to a tiny \"Oompa-Loompa\" (Hugh Grant) who looks like he's spent way too long on the sun-bed. With his own debt to pay, the two agree an alliance that - well we all know what happens to that. It's a little over-choreographed, I think, and the original songs are not especially memorable, but it doesn't hang about and there's no doubting that Chalamet is enjoying himself, and that's a little bit contagious and we head to a denouement that takes fondue to a ridiculous level... It features a strong and well matched ensemble cast and though maybe a little too long, I did enjoy it.",
            "Enjoyed this!\r\n\r\n2023's <em>'Wonka'</em> is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.\r\n\r\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.\r\n\r\nTom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.\r\n\r\nSomeone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).",

As a busy software engineer with a penchant for quality family time, I couldn't have asked for a better choice for our movie night.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the film began, it whisked us away on a whimsical journey into the magical world of Wonka's chocolate factory. The visual spectacle and attention to detail were captivating, and I found myself marveling at the creativity on screen. The vibrant colors and imaginative set designs truly brought the beloved story to life.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Wonka apart is its ability to strike a perfect balance between nostalgia for those familiar with the classic tale and a fresh, modern twist that keeps the storyline engaging. The characters are charming, and the casting choices are spot-on. Timothee Chalamet as Wonka brings a new energy to the character, and his performance is both endearing and entertaining.\r\n\r\nI came across this movie at :\r\nhttps://mustwatchmovies.xyz/movie/114901/wonka\r\n\r\nOne aspect that stood out to me, as someone deeply involved in technology, was the seamless integration of CGI and practical effects. The visual effects team did a commendable job, creating a world that felt both magical and believable. The attention to detail, from the intricate machinery in the factory to the playful Oompa Loompas, was truly commendable.\r\n\r\nWonka is not just a feast for the eyes; it also delivers a heartwarming message about the importance of imagination, creativity, and the joy of shared experiences. As someone who manages an affiliate network and values family time, I can confidently recommend this movie for a fun-filled outing with loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Wonka is a cinematic delight that appeals to the child in all of us. Whether you're a parent looking for a wholesome family film or just someone who appreciates a well-crafted story, this movie is a must-see. Grab your tickets, some popcorn, and treat yourself to a heartwarming adventure that will leave you with a sweet taste of nostalgia.",
            "Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet\u2019s performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.\r\n\r\nThe film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothee Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.\r\n\r\nOne has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.",

            "#MovieReview #WonkaMovie #Wonka\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that this movie is truly amazing from start to finish. It stands out for its focus on a fantastic storyline without any political agenda, overly emphasized themes, or unnecessary controversies. Instead, it offers a captivating narrative, an exceptional cast, and outstanding music.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, this movie is a delightful treat, filled with delicious surprises and exquisite chocolates. It brings the joy of craving candy, even though Willy Wonka's confectioneries are not widely available, adding to the allure.\r\n\r\nWhile the film incorporates comedy, it strikes a balance, avoiding excessive cheesiness. The cast, including actors I initially doubted, delivers phenomenal performances throughout.\r\n\r\nThe emotional depth of Willy Wonka's character, from his childhood trauma to his aspirations for success, is portrayed with authenticity. The movie sheds light on his motivations for owning a chocolate factory, a detail not fully explored in previous adaptations.\r\n\r\nThroughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing, smiling, and even shedding a few tears during the poignant moments. The charm and magic of the movie truly come alive on the big screen, making it a must-watch in theaters. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet impresses with his acting and surprising singing abilities.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the original films, this adaptation strikes a balance between storytelling and musical numbers. The music enhances the narrative without overshadowing the plot, enriching the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe iconic song sung by Chalamet towards the end of the movie evokes nostalgia and captures the essence of the Willy Wonka legacy, resonating with fans of all ages.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend experiencing this film in theaters for the full cinematic experience. I eagerly anticipate a potential sequel exploring Willy Wonka's future, especially with Hugh Grant's rumored involvement as an Oompa Loompa.\r\n\r\nSo, grab your candy, settle in with your popcorn, and savor this excellent cinematic"

            "Out of all the films nominated for best picture, there is one that isn\u2019t getting much attention at all. In Hacksaw Ridge, the narrative surrounding the film doesn\u2019t have much to do the film at all because it\u2019s identity seems to be centered on Mel Gibson\u2019s comeback.\r\n\r\nRead More: https://reviews.boxofficebuz.com/review/hacksaw-ridge",
            "I first saw Hacksaw Ridge, back in November when it first came out.. Went to an afternoon screening and it was packed. From the very first scene to the last , I was in awe. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a 5 minute standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",
            "**On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.**\r\n\r\nThe film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",
            "Most of these men don't believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe. \r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",
            "***Tribute to a real-life WW2 \u201cconscientious collaborator\u201d*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss\u2019 potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding \u201cPlatoon\u201d (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn\u2019t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one\u2019s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren\u2019t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple \u2013 throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They\u2019re wrong. Sometimes it\u2019s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",
            "**A really good movie, which only lacks in some details.**\r\n\r\nThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, \u201cWe Were Soldiers\u201d, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond.\r\n\r\nSon of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light.\r\n\r\nThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit clich\u00e9, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor.\r\n\r\nIn general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more.",
            "I don't want to say that I dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, I mean he's been in plenty of movies that I love... but like Clint Eastwood, he makes a FAR better director than he ever made an actor.\r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is just one of those films where he does a great job... unfortunately it is Mel Gibson, so it's over-the-top carnage that is not at all underplayed. But you can't fault Gibson for making a Gibson film, you should really know as much coming in.\r\n\r\nAnd he actually got Andre Garfield to act, which might not win him a reward, but it certainly should, that is a something that could get a man canonized... and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years. He seems like a real actor in this, accent and all.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, it's the story of a pacifist who went to war to save lives... and in the end that's pretty noble by the strictest definition and you feel it though out, which is probably the point... despite the over-the-top carnage."

The character complexity and the chilling intensity of the cinematography and sound production contribute to a powerfully engaging, repeatedly shocking audiovisual experience.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tribute to a profession often forgotten, but equally a challenge for viewers to reflect on critical issues in contemporary society.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "Terrific movie!\r\n\r\n<em>'Civil War'</em> is a blast from beginning to end, I enjoyed everything about it to be honest. It features an interesting story that is told with excellence. My biggest takeaway is the sound design, which is outstanding; literally from the first seconds post-BBFC black card.\r\n\r\nIt is paced absolutely spot on, the end comes around so quick; probably because I was hooked. The cast do great jobs. Obvious credit to Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura and Stephen McKinley Henderson, they are all ace. Cailee Spaeny is my personal standout though, what an excellent showing from her!\r\n\r\nEngrossing viewing. Highly recommended. Very much want to rewatch it already.",
            "Nope, sorry, this just didn't work for me. It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of \"Falling Skies\" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",
            "Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that\u2019s certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker\u2019s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, \u201cCivil War\u201d provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what\u2019s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists\u2019 journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn\u2019t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won\u2019t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that\u2019s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to \u201cget the story,\u201d no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture\u2019s message is one of grave importance, especially in today\u2019s trying, polarized climate. We\u2019d be wise to pay attention to what\u2019s being said in this important work, handily the best \u2013 and most troubling \u2013 release of 2024 thus far.",
            "The film, although set in a context of armed conflict, deviates from the traditional war theme to focus on war photojournalists, promoting a perspective on the work of such professionals. Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.\r\n\r\nEach scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.\r\n\r\nAlthough technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.",
            "In spite of its pretensions, Civil War is essentially a derivative affair filled with  calculatedly disturbing visuals and violent exposition.\r\n\r\nCharacter development and a functioning back story are largely absent, from Civil War. This is an exposition driven road trip from hell, with a nihilistic objective, that plays out to a predictable conclusion. \r\n\r\nThat does not really leave a lot, for the viewer, to take away from this film. A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?\r\n\r\nIn summary, this film really needed to be more opinionated, even if that means offering up opposing perspectives. Instead, it offends no one (as is the norm these days) by saying little to nothing, of any real consequence.",
            "**Not bad**\r\n\r\nI stared with low expectations, but this movies indeed turned out to be a good one. Fantastic story, acting, direction. No major complaints.\r\n\r\nEntertaining and thought provoking. Well done!",
            "I really enjoyed this movie, wan't expecting much and got a lot. recommend.",
            "I wonder if the older guy gets with the young lady. He definitely worked for it. Bet he knows exactly how many near death experiences it takes before they fall into his arms. Seems like a lot just to bang someone, though.\r\n\r\nNews, news, news. Gotta get that story.",
            "This film is wonderfully chilling, with an atmosphere that haunts you long after the credits roll. The familiar settings of cities, towns, and roads serve as a stark backdrop to a raging war within the United States, creating a sense of unsettling normalcy disrupted by chaos.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s atmosphere is one of its strongest elements, expertly crafted to keep viewers on edge. The juxtaposition of familiar, everyday settings with the terror of internal conflict adds a layer of realism that intensifies the horror. \r\n\r\nKirsten Dunst delivers one of her best performances in this film, bringing depth and nuance to her role. Her portrayal captures the fear, resilience, and complexity of a character navigating through turmoil. The supporting cast is equally fantastic, each bringing their characters to life with authenticity and emotional weight. \r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s themes are deeply resonant, exploring the terrifying implications of a society on the brink of collapse. The narrative delves into the human psyche, examining how people react under extreme pressure and the moral dilemmas they face. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this movie is a masterclass in atmospheric horror.

            "I was very interested in watching Civil War for a number of reasons. Mainly I wanted to see how the various political sides were portrayed in the very divided \"United\" States.  Indeed, there are many countries in the world that are near evenly split amongst two groups: High Government Involvement (money, immigration, etc.) vs. Free Market Capitalism.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was no coverage of that in Civil War, with the only difference being regions, letting you imagine on your own the differences. They are relying on a regional stereotype to push that the \"South\" is made up of angry white people that just like killing those that don't agree with them.  That put the movie right away into a political category.\r\n\r\nWhen the movie had finished, I was left with some lasting feelings that were intentionally pushed by the story and director:\r\n1) the international press are the only real heroes; 2) all American white men just like war and killing.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that this seemed to be the main narrative from start to finish. There were so many missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nSummary:  The was like a little like watching the movie Apocalypse Now with the sole main character being the press photographer who was always portrayed as the hero.\r\n\r\nThe writer and director pushed that those many wartime videographers had a large audience that only desired seeing the upclose expressions from people that were shot and dying. They also pushed that they would be so highly respected and protected from all waring sides. Those continual assumptions caused the movie to lose significant realism.\r\n\r\nWith such a large production budget and vast thirst for this movie topic, Civil War was a major letdown. Better writing and direction could have made this a movie blockbuster. Instead, it won't be remembered in 3-5 years, and certainly no one would every consider rewatching it.",

            "Good adaptation and performances from Knightley and MacFayden.",
            "When I watched this version of the Austen classic prior to packing the DVD away for a move, I assumed ahead of time it would stay nestled behind the Colin Firth version as my second favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Now, however, pending my watching the other version again, this might indeed be my new favorite. Not due to any major differences in acting ability or in the writing, but rather for the way it nails down the little things, the stuff I may not have noticed the first time or two I watched it.\r\n\r\nOne simple example is of the portrayal of Mary, one of the servants in the Bennet household. She says hardly anything during the course of the movie, but a couple of times we follow her while she is singing as she works, and I found it utterly charming. And I think it illustrates, whether or not it was intended, that this is a pleasant house that servants did not dread to start their work days in. \r\n\r\nThere is also at one of the balls a long scene of dancing that shows several of the characters who are involved in subplots going on, all within this continuous shot. It is clever, and on one website it is said the camera was left running by accident; a happy accident if you ask me. Also, a few of the scenic moments, such as one time when Elizabeth merely stares lost in thought in the middle of great beauty, are amiable natural breaks in the action.\r\n\r\nThe acting is very good, of course, with this cast, but also their attitude is perfect. Brenda Blethyn excels in the thankless role of the silly mother, managing not to cross the line into looking outright ridiculous. Sutherland is \u2014 well, I will give any movie a try with him in it. Keira Knightly is, for me, astonishingly good. If you had described to me before I watched it the way, when she or her family is insulted, she looks jolted for a moment, but then with a short laugh or smile shakes it off, I would have said \u201cNope, that won\u2019t work.\u201d But it works. Her wit is sensational. I write fiction myself and always try to to feature witty female characters, and Elizabeth would fit right into my modern novels.\r\n\r\nDame Penelope Wilton is excellent as always, and Claudia Blakey shone as Charlotte. If pressed to find at least one small fault, I could only say that I think the writers and director (and possibly Jane Austen herself) may have underestimated Mary Bennet as a character. I have always thought that more could be done with her, in every version.\r\n\r\nI am only sorry now I have to pack the DVD away for the movie, even if only for a few weeks.",
            "**Overall, it's a good adaptation, even if it's not free of mistakes and problems.**\r\n\r\nI believe that \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is one of the most transported English novels to film and television. I've seen more than one adaptation, and each one has its merits and problems (however, it's generally agreed that the 1995 miniseries is the most perfect and canonical). This film is not as good as I would like it to be, it has several problems, but it is quite acceptable and also has positive notes to retain.\r\n\r\nHere, the story we already know so well takes place in the final years of the 18th century. From what I saw, the director wanted to do this to avoid the fashion of the Regency period, which he doesn't like, and taking advantage of the fact that Austen wrote the early version of the book around this time. Well, I can say that I share the thoughts of the director, Joe Wright, when it comes to dresses from the Regency/First French Empire period. Aesthetically, they are much less interesting than the \u201cbridal cakes\u201d of the pre-French Revolution period, or the wide dresses that began to be worn in the Romantic period. The idea of these dresses, which greatly emphasize the woman's chest and then fall straight down like a nightgown, is in a way imitating what the Romans and Greeks were thought to wear. Even so, there are several errors in the way the characters were dressed, arranged, combed and characterized: basically, the director ignored everything that didn't suit him. That was a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe film is reasonably short for the literary work it brings, but I think it couldn't be otherwise. For the rest, the narrative is decently done, and the adaptation made to the source material is quite conscientious and tries not to cut important things. What I didn't like was the way certain characters were developed: Elizabeth became a wild girl and much less contained than would be supposed in the novel, for example. The rest, however, is quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe film is full of great British actors: in addition to Keira Knightley, who manages well in the role of protagonist, we also have Rosamund Pike, Brenda Blethyn, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone and Judy Dench. Each did a fairly good job in the role assigned to them. We should also appreciate the work of Matthew MacFadyen, Donald Sutherland, Simon Woods and Tom Hollander. On a technical level, the film invests a lot in good sets, convincing and well-selected shooting locations and good props. The cinematography is also good and does an excellent job throughout the film, with enviable camera work and good colors and lighting. The film also has a good soundtrack.",
            "Seen this one a couple of times and with my internet being out and wanting to revisit, decided to give it another watch. Still highly enjoyable and engaging romantic-drama with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen giving fine performances. **3.75/5**",
            "You can't help but feel sorry for poor old \"Mr. Bennet\" (Donald Sutherland) in this drama. He is married to a domineering wife (Brenda Blethyn) and has five, yes - five daughters! They are upper-middle class, gentile and well-to-do but have a problem. The laws of inheritance insist that upon his death, their home shall pass to a distance cousin so it's important that the girls make as best a way in life for themselves as they can. That might be simpler for the beautiful \"Jane\" (Rosamund Pike) but for the others. Well there's the girlish \"Kitty\" (Carey Mulligan); the tomboyish \"Lydia\" (Jena malone); the studious \"Mary' (Talulah Riley) and the independently minded \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley). It's the last who is likely to prove the most problematic as she has no intention of just marrying the local cleric \"Collins\" (Tom Hollander) or some drippy soldier like \"Mr. Wickham\" (Rupert Friend). Indeed, she only just manages to stay on the right side of good manners at a supper with the imperious \"Lady Catherine\" (Dame Judi Dench) who is surprised by her youthful fortitude of character. As ever, though, with Jane Austin there is a degree of inevitability about the denouement and when we are introduced to the equally strong willed \"Darcy\" (Matthew Macfadyen) we know that for all of their dancing around each other, their sparring, strops and tantrums there will be a spark, and whether or not that spark manifests itself into true love is the purpose of this story. Along the way, the production designer and the costumers have filled their boots. The film oozes stately homes and fine costumes, the writing enlivens almost everyone - especially the on-form Blethyn whilst Dames Judi and Penelope (Wilton) bring some gravitas to offset the engaging effort from Knightley in a role the could almost have been written for her engaging performance here. The Darcy role is amiably enough played, but that role isn't really so important in substance - it's more about his dashing eye-candiness factor that is supposed to have the hearts a-fluttering. Dario Marianelli has written a score that complements the story almost perfectly and though I did think it just a bit too long, this is classily constructed assessment of the vagaries of human nature, snobbery, aspiration and sheer bloody-mindedness and is well worth a gander."

            "**mild abstract spoiler ahead**\r\n\r\nMy feelings about this movie may very well be extended towards Boyle's movies in general : solid direction overall, but events did not fail to go from situational and behavioral realism to sudden heroical action nonsense.",
            "It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...\r\n\r\n28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.\r\n\r\nWhen animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as \"Rage\", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...\r\n\r\n28 days later... \r\n\r\nThe amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). \r\n\r\nThere's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for \"28 Weeks Later\". It's not as raw as \"Days\", but it's gorier and itself also a fine \"infected\" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.\r\n\r\nA great cast and premise get down and dirty In a sharply executed infected based horror. 8.5/10",
            "_28 Days Later_ was made on a very small budget in the early days of digital cinema, so, yes, in retrospect, it does look a little bit like it was shot on a Nokia 3310, and yes, it is heavily responsible for the bilious deluge of zombie movies we got in its wake, which we are only now finally recovering from - but it's so **good**. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._",
            "One of the best zombie movies ever made with many of the genre's \"firsts:\" \r\n\r\n1. The first that begins with an actual explanation of what created the zombie plague. \r\n2. The first to introduce a fast-moving \"infected\" horde, ratching up the tension significantly. \r\n3. The first to infect people instantly (within seconds). \r\n\r\nIt also has one of the best movie scores, one that rivals those from John Carpenter classics \"Halloween\" and \"The Thing.\" It is striking how the music can elevate a movie or a scene. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue, which to be fair, is not something Danny Boyle and his crew could have foreseen, is that it was shot in low quality SD, making it nearly unwatchable on large screen modern HD or 4K TV's.",
            "\"28 Days Later\" is a British horror movie directed by Danny Boyle and starring Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. The film tells the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy), a courier who wakes up from a coma to find London abandoned and overrun by rage-infected humans.\r\n\r\nThe film's opening sequence is one of the most iconic and powerful in horror movie history. Jim wakes up in a hospital room to find the world he knew has disappeared, and the eerily deserted streets of London make for an unsettling and ominous backdrop.\r\n\r\nThe film is expertly paced, with a gradual buildup of tension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The infected humans are terrifying, fast-moving, and relentlessly violent, and the film's use of sound and lighting only heightens their impact.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of \"28 Days Later\" is the excellent acting by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. Murphy delivers a convincing performance as Jim, a man struggling to survive in a world gone mad, while Harris shines as Selena, a tough survivor who has learned to navigate the dangers of the new world.\r\n\r\nThe film's themes of survival, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit are powerful and thought-provoking. As Jim and Selena make their way through the deserted streets of London, they encounter a range of characters, each with their own story of survival and loss.\r\n\r\nThe film's cinematography and visual effects are also top-notch, with haunting and memorable shots of a deserted London and intense action sequences that will leave you breathless.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"28 Days Later\" is a masterful horror movie that sets the bar high for the genre. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for a truly unforgettable experience. I would rate \"28 Days Later\" a 8 out of 10.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWritten and Reviewed by RSOliveira",
            "Despite being warned that a group of monkeys about to be released from a lab by some anti-vivisectionists are laced with disease, they let one of them out anyway and next thing it's a month later and \"Jim\" (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital all by himself. There's not a soul to be seen, anywhere. He can't spend the entire film wandering about naked, so finds some scrubs and goes exploring - gradually gleaning information about the plague that led to the evacuation of the cities and to his current isolation. It's not as if he had anything to do with the release of this virus, but he now has to deal with it's consequences. Luckily he encounters \"Selena\" (Naomie Harris) and \"Mark\" (Noah Huntley) who save him from a marauding mob (think \"Omega Man\" from 1971) and their risky adventures begin trying to find what's left of humanity and hopefully safety. A wind-up radio broadcast gives them some hope, and off they travel with newfound friends \"Frank\" (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter \"Hannah\" (Megan Burns) in their black taxi (so of course, it takes a circuitous route) to Manchester. Their arrival visits tragedy on the small group but also introduces them to the last bastions of military security - under the command of \"Maj. West\" (Christopher Eccleston). Pretty swiftly they realise that very little of this new scenario is much safer for them and their thoughts turn to leaving...! This is quite an effective apocalyptic tale of corrupted science and morals and uses, for most of the first section of the film, dialogue sparingly allowing the eerie photography and soundtrack of a largely abandoned London to set the scene for us. Thereafter the writing isn't the best, but the benign sense of menace exuded by Eccleston and the confidence of both Harris and the young Burns work well at giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of peril, especially as we drift to a denouement that is cleverly constructed to make us think. It's bleak and threatening at times, not without the odd dark humour and in the end presents us with quite an intriguing look at humanity in many of it's less attractive, more visceral, guises. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland keep a few twists for the tale at the end, too, and Murphy holds it all together in an understatedly potent fashion."

            "Hormones over excitement as part six is merely an appetiser to the double billed closure to come.\r\n\r\nDeath Eaters are running amok as Dumbledore has an important task for Harry and Voldermort has one for Draco; all set to the backdrop of raging adolescent hormones. While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.\r\n\r\nPotter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.\r\n\r\nA filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10",
            "The seventh installment, the appetiser.\r\n\r\nAs the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the \"Horcruxes\" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.\r\n\r\nSo this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.\r\n\r\nNew additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!\r\n\r\nTension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10",

            "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince may be the most mature film of the franchise with fantastic character development, but at the cost of action and a somewhat slow pace.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the film suffers from what a lot of these films do where the audience is taken from location to location, without any explanation as to why. It is difficult to follow at times, but it's a sacrifice that unfortunately has to be made when adapting a long novel into a feature-length film. Despite this film being the slowest of the series, it does a tremendous amount of leg work setting up the epic conclusion. From the introduction of the Horcruxes to the multiple scenes of Voldemort's past, the audience gets a ton of background information revealing details from the previous film that creates a more coherent story structure.\r\n\r\nHalf-Blood Prince has a more focused return to Hogwarts and the class aspect which I enjoyed. Jim Broadbent's Professor Horace was a great addition and his connection with Potter is so seamless, with some aid from the Half-Blood Prince's textbook. Not only does Harry have great chemistry with Professor Horace, but his relationship with Dumbledore blossoms, and his reverence for the headmaster is captivating. It was great to see these two finally working together and trusting each other. Previously Harry would always hold information or Dumbledore would tell Harry to never mind, but finally, they get on the same page, and it was great to see.\r\n\r\nThis connection aids tremendously in the final scenes of the film. The trials that these two characters are put through are immense, but Harry's trust in Dumbledore is shown in a very uncomfortable scene of Dumbledore forcing down a poison of some sort. This struggle crescendos into an incredibly impactful finale with Dumbledore, unfortunately, dying at the hands of Snape. There were some fantastic character moments between Snape and Malfoy, and the light inside both of them is hinted at in this final scene. Dumbledore's death is felt, not only by the students of Hogwarts but by the audience as well. This is one of the more effective deaths in the series due to the audience's time with the character, as opposed to the death of Sirius Black in the previous film.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is slow and can drag on a bit. But there are some great character moments and plot developments that make this a fantastic beginning of the end for the series.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%\r\nVerdict Great",
            "David Yates now really begins to take these stories to a new, potently darker level as \"Harry\" (Daniel Radcliffe) comes into possession of a book - formerly the property of the eponymous Prince. His skills increase exponentially and he soon begins to question whether he, himself, might be closer to the evil lord \"Voldemort\" than he had ever thought. The three principals are very much on the same wavelength now; the supporting cast likewise and there is even a little late hormonal activity as the awkwardness of teenage years (remember?) starts to feature too. This film also sees the arrival of Jim Broadbent as \"Slughorn\" - quite an engagingly enigmatic character and we can easily now sense that the battle lines are starting to be drawn... This is highly entertaining cinema. A big scale production and fine scoring builds on a strong story with characters we now know. A big screen must."

I was sold by the whole vibe of it from the very beginning, sometimes you can just tell you're going to absolutely enjoy something from the opening minutes and this, for me, was one of those films.\r\n\r\nThe casting is terrific, many well known faces appear. Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine (how about that speech), Christian Bale and Scarlett Johansson are all brilliant, the latter two do hold minimally iffy accents though; or maybe it was just me. There are a few other strong performers too, like Andy Serkis and David Bowie! No-one onscreen puts a foot wrong.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan is again back to his twisty best with this one. It's admittedly nothing as super deep as, say, <em>'Inception'</em> and I did read where this one was going in certain aspects, though certainly not every angle - either way, it's just as thrilling to watch no matter how much or how little you pick up. Big fan of the way the film depicts its events throughout.\r\n\r\nJust now seeing how highly this is regarded, on Letterboxd at least. I know I do try to avoid as much as I can with movies, but based on the aforementioned I'm kinda shocked I hadn't heard anything about this growing up or even in recent years. Most of Nolan's other works I at least recall hearing through the grapevine, yet this one evidently somehow slipped through the net. Probably a good thing, mind you.",
            "As ever with Christopher Nolan films the chronology needs close attention - as so many of the clues as to what the hell is actually going on require a considerable degree of concentration (and multiple viewings) before any semblance of quality emanates from the outwardly cluttered and, frankly, preposterous plot. We start with Christian Bale (\"Borden\") about to swing for the murder of Hugh Jackman (\"Angier\") but of course it is not that simple; and through a series of complex flashbacks we discover just how these two, erstwhile friends and colleagues, got themselves into this predicament. This is a story about ambition, obsession - to succeed and to hate; it has elements of love - both men have relationships, one the cause of their estrangement; the other (with Scarlett Johansson) continues to fuel it. The whole nature of their profession - illusionists; conjurers of/to the imagination - lends itself splendidly to the subject of this vendetta. The look of the film is first class, with Wally Pfister creating a gem of vivid imagery with some wonderful visual effects too. The performances are OK - they are not great; the dialogue is likewise. For a film essentially about seeing being believing (or not) the script is frequently too wordy and overpowers the subtle opportunities for the actors to demonstrate rather than speak their parts. Sir Michael Caine probably brings the most authentic accent to the proceedings - the others left me needing quite a bit of convincing; and the brief appearances of David Bowie as Tesla were a poor choice of casting, I felt. This is a good film, and I enjoyed it - but I did need to watch it 4 times before I felt half way comfortable writing anything down about it!"

            "I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan's Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms\u2014it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect.",
            "I personally thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.\r\n\r\nWhilst some think the film is too long for the story I didn't find this. The length of the film is longer than some (but doesn't feel it), I liked that the film took it's time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman series so far.\r\n\r\nStupendously good film in my opinion.",
            "The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of, I my opinion, the best bad guys in any movie, Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended).",
            "No doubt that the movie is one of the best movies of this era.\r\nThe film doesn't lack in whatever it try to do.It has Simple narration with extraordinary Direction,Acting,Music,Cinematography and a lot of qualities.\r\nChristian Bale is supremely entertaining for sure.\r\nThe person behind the scenes is actually the real core creater of the film yes! The Director Christopher Nolan \u2764 .\r\nThe film ofcorse completes with philosophical quality loaded with Lots of Sacrifices.\r\nThis one is the one you surely can't afford to miss.\r\nGo watch The Dark Knight.Go now.",
            "While it's clearly not as superlative as its famous predecessor, it's simply because of both Heath Ledger's outstanding and Oscar-winning performance, and the character of the Joker's etching in our collective unconscious as the greatest comic-book villain ever created (with Lex Luthor a very distant second place). This is still a masterwork, and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made. As great as Christopher Nolan is as a director, and as fine a film as 'Interstellar' is, I really don't know if he'll ever be able to top his work here, on these three films. But I, for one, am certainly looking forward to finding out...",
            "So here we have it. The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang...\r\n\r\nGoing into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.\r\n\r\nThis third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody\u2019s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman...\r\n\r\nThis somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nI would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.\r\n\r\nI understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.\r\n\r\nNow, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown.\r\n\r\nI would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR\u2019s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. \r\n\r\nAs much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 \u00bd hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. It is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.\r\n_(July 2012)_",
            "Batman was one of my childhood heroes from the Comic magazines even though the Swedish plonkers, in their infinite stupidity, had renamed him to something as ridiculous \u201cL\u00e4derlappen\u201d which basically translates into \u201cpatch of leather\u201d.\r\n\r\nThus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.\r\n\r\nI think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn\u2019t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other \u201cguy\u201d it would probably have been excellent but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys.\r\n\r\nInstead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f\u2026 is that? It isn\u2019t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it\u2019s not very exciting.\r\n\r\nActually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn\u2019t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.\r\n\r\nI was struggling with what to give this movie but in the end, since I probably would have thought it to be a good movie if it had not been labelled as a Batman movie, I gave it 5 out 10 stars. At least the special effects where quite okay.",
            "\"And when it is done, and Gotham is in ashes, then you have my permission to die.\" - Bane, the Dark Knight Rises.\r\n\r\nAn epic, amazing end to the Dark Knight trilogy, with great acting, numerous complex subplots, a creepy villain, amazing action scenes and a heart-thumping score. I really love this film and consider it one of Nolan's better works, and I wish more people on the Internet would start giving it more respect.\r\n\r\nOh, also, I really don't care about the small plot holes like the magic mechanical leg and Bruce appearing in Gotham when he was at the desert shortly before - do you really want to see ten minutes of Bruce using plastic surgery to fix his bone, or him in a airport going to Gotham?",
            "Even though the plot feels messier than the previous two installments, one cannot resist a smile after the unexpected twist and final scenes, which make \u2018The Dark Knight Rises\u2019 a worthy final chapter of Nolan's epical trilogy.\r\n\r\n9/10",
            "Tom Hardy is superb in this denouement to Christopher Nolan's \"Batman\" trilogy. His depiction of the clever and malevolent \"Bane\" is intricate and terrifying in equal measure. Christian Bale also has the role very much under control now as he joins forces with his old pal \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) and jewel thief turned \"Catwoman\" (Anne Hathaway) to rise to his biggest challenge yet... What's great about this film is that is ties up all of the loose ends from the first two; it dots some i's and crosses the t's as the story neatly, and frequently quite subtly, introduces new threads to an old suit of clothes. This is an hugely characterful outing for all concerned - especially Sir Michael Caine as the wonderfully underplayed \"Alfred\" and Morgan Freeman as the arch-inventor \"Fox\". The plot takes it's time to develop, there is plenty of to-ing and fro-ing as they battle for the upper hand; new allies must learn to trust and to rely on each other. I found myself drawn to the \"Bane\" cause more than I ought to admit - a sign of a great baddie; you empathise with the evil (I think of \"Darth Vader\") especially once the story unveils traits in his character and elements of his history that, to a certain extent, justify his behaviour. The dialogue is sparing and potent and photography is really effective: the light and shade are used creatively with the Hans Zimmer score an huge improvement on his last outing. This is certainly one for a big screen - there is loads to see each time you watch, and though \"Batman\" was never my favourite super-hero, this has to be up there as one of the darkest and best super-hero films.",

            "Struggles desperately to be three movies at once: One about Pokemon, one about proto-Voldemort and one (uncharacteristically dark story) about child abuse. But none of these three movies are bad movies so _Fantastic Beasts_ gets a pass from me. \r\n\r\nI was particularly fond of the degree to which it tied into the Harry Potter world at large. There were moments were I went \u201cOh Harry\u2019s used that same spell before!\u201d or characters that fitted naturally into the narrative being mentioned, as opposed to getting all _Agents of SHIELD_ season 1 on us, and awkwardly name-dropping something from the other films every 5 minutes, just in case we forgot, which was what I was afraid it might do.\r\n\r\nEnd result, _Fantastic Beasts_ is a flawed film that I was still very happy to have watched, and exceeded my expectations.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "I must say I was expecting to like it, and I really liked it despite the few generic moments throughout the film. \r\n\r\nCan watch again/10.",
            "Personally I found this movie to be 2+ hours of excellent entertainment. This is one of these movies where I simply cannot understand how people can give one and two star ratings stating that it is garbage etc. I do not get what these people expected? Maybe they just have to complain? The original Harry Potter books are very much books for children or young adults and so is this movie. It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.\r\n\r\nThe magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.\r\n\r\nIf I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves  a top rating.",
            "**Well, everything's in the title itself, you watch it only to confirm.**\r\n\r\nI don't want to be so negative like the film critics, but this is a big disappointment for me watching being a film fanatic. I don't think anyone who loved 'Harry Potter' film series would thumb this new beginning. This is not like 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' from the same universe, but different trilogies. I was excited for something like that, as a concept wise, for the fresh tale from from the fresh characters in the same universe. I don't know about the book version, but the film did not click for me.\r\n\r\nIt had a bunch of nice characters, and to set in the Harry Potter universe, really it should have been a masterpiece. The major drawback was the story. There's nothing to appreciate the screenplay. It's about some creatures from the magical world got out in the human world, just like 'Jumanji'. So our hero struggles to recapture them. Meanwhile, some others too involved in and the reason will be revealed in the final stage.\r\n\r\nNice casting and great visuals. I won't point out its director's fault, because he has done his duty very well. He's also will be the man behind the rest of the sequels. I think it deserved the Oscars for the costume design. Not a bad film, particularly for the kids. Comparing it with the Harry Potter franchise makes it a worst film, but independently it is an okay film. So the initiation was average, but I'm still expecting the follow ups to be much better.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",
            "Remarkably lacklustre for a film involving magical creatures.\r\n\r\n<em>'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'</em> underwhelmed me, in short. At no moment across the 130 or so minute run time was I ever invested or drawn into the story or the characters. I didn't feel any good performances from the cast either. Dan Fogler sticks out in my memory most, though the rest are forgettable.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are also not to the level I was expecting; that's not to say that they are bad and I'm not certain what I was indeed anticipating from them, but I just found 'em to be meh - nothing blew me away. Which is a vibe that I got from the whole film unfortunately.\r\n\r\nHopefully <em>'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald'</em> does more for me.",
            "Hats have to come off here to Eddie Redmayne. I reckon he must have spent virtually all of the filming days staring at a green screen reacting to CGI. That's my problem with this. Though set in a fantasy world, there's nothing remotely authentic about it. Not his \"Newt Scamander\" character, nor the constantly changing scenarios that are busily trying to engage our eyes without bothering with our brains. \"Newt\" arrives from Britain into the USA with a magical suitcase full of creatures that is the target of the dastardly \"Grindelwald\" (a few fleeting appearances from Johnny Depp). When it is stolen and some of the beasties escape, it looks like a bad time to be insuring the properties of New York's Fifth Avenue and with all hell breaking loose, \"Newt\" and his new muggle friend \"Jacob\" (Dan Fogler) to round them all up and thwart a plan that will bring the wizarding world to the brink chaos. There's no denying that the film looks great, with astonishing attention to detail and an impressive imagination behind the design of mystical creatures and their animated visual effects. The thing has no soul, though. Unlike with her earlier \"Potter\" characters, JK Rowling hasn't really created anyone here about whom I really cared. There are some fun critters - the curious platypus and their own mini version of \"Groot\", but Redmayne just seems to be rushing around reacting all the time, without us really getting to know him or much about his mission. Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller and Depp suffer likewise, with little effort put into imbuing them with much persona. Even the magic itself seems sterile and derivative. It's not terrible, it's more a sort of \"so what\" that you just know will spawn loads of predicable sequels and \"Newt\" and \"Grindelwald\" square up for a battle royal."

It\u2019s rare to find a movie that depicts a healthy, caring relationship between family members, so I enjoyed seeing support rather than drama.

            "The kinetic super-spy caper \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 will serve as a boisterous blueprint for those teen fanboys out there that will fancy an elaborate overload of James Bond-esque high-powered hedonism. It certainly does not hurt that the high-wire hysteria as showcased in the twitchy \u2018Kingman\u2019 is based upon the acclaimed comicbook series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. Also, add into the mix the movie-making overdrive pedigree of director Matthew Vaughn (\u2018Kick-Ass\u2019, \u2018X-Men: First Class\u2019) and slick, cheeky spy-spry send-ups that recall the over-the-top espionage genre and its exaggerated suspense-driven foundation. Well, \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 is a cockeyed, pulsating parody that works its ultra-violent magic for the Austin Powers crowd that wants to walk on the high-octane wild side of Bond\u2019s universe.\r\n\r\nSure, \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 has its iffy moments where the blatant sexist overtones, magnified violent sequences and a generous bloody bounce of excess will have some stomping their feet in sheer indignation. The apparent knock on \u2018Kingsman\u2019 will be its robust ridiculousness and familiarity in Vaughn\u2019s \u2018Kick-Ass\u2019 cartoonish vibe. However, the same elements that may cause some reservations with the film\u2019s low-brow lunacy is also the same ingredients that trigger \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019s carousing charm in majestic mayhem.\r\n\r\nThe grand gimmick behind behind kick-starting \u2018Kingsman\u2019s go-for-broke rollicking is casting the sophisticated presence of the Oscar-winning Colin Firth (\u2018The King\u2019s Speech\u2019) as dapper Harry Hart (aka \u2018Galahad\u2019), a polished and prominent superspy for a British secret intelligence society.  Hart\u2019s top-secret spy network is headed up by Arthur (Oscar-winner Michael Caine). The secretive operation is based out of a notable tailor\u2019s shop known as Kingsman. Also worth noting is that all the secret service agents are named after the famed knights of King Arthur\u2019s Round Table. Go figure. In any event, the suave Harry Hart is the debonair face of the spy organisation and will play a critical part in both recruiting a young up-and-coming agent with decent physical skills and tracking down a worldwide menace bent of destroying the planet. It is all in a day\u2019s work for the skilled, well-dressed licensed-to-kill operative.\r\n\r\nHart, who had been loyally connected to a fallen colleague from a past mission gone disastrous years before, decides to become a mentor for his late co-worker\u2019s troubled son Gary \u2018Eggsy\u2019 Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) whose law-breaking conduct catches the attention of the police. Feeling a sense of responsibility for his deceased spy buddy\u2019s wayward kid, Hart takes Eggsy under his wings and determines to shape the misguided youngster into resilient Kingman stock. After all, Eggsy has the needed physicality (we are told he is an exceptional gymnast) and roguish spunk to join the ranks of the seemingly understaffed spy outfit. Soon, Eggy and other recruits will be grilled through rigorous training from Kingman member Merlin (Mark Strong) as they look to fill the spot vacated recently from the dead Lancelot.\r\n\r\nThe dearly departed Lancelot, it turns out, was the latest victim of ruthless criminal mastermind Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). The flashy Valentine, a billionaire gone bonkers, hopes to control the world\u2019s climate change. He is known as a mega-wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist but his sinister heart yearns for some heavy-handed dastardly deeds that puts him on the immediate radar for Hart and his crafty Kingsmen to spring into action. At the demented Valentine\u2019s side is the deliciously disabled exotic henchwoman Gazelle (Sophia Boutella) with the treacherous knack for disarming her adversaries with blazing blades.\r\n\r\nThe bombastic and eye-pleasing \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 sets out to have one goal in mind: to highlight its thunderous homage to spygate spectacles that salute everything from the Agent 007 flicks and related free-wheeling 60\u2019s fare such as the \u2018Matt Helm\u2019 and \u2018Derek Flint\u2019 spy franchises to the recent espionage vehicles that invite the millennium-based harried heroes such as the Jason Bournes and Jack Ryans of the world into the frenetic fold.  It is fast, furious and unapologetic in its rambunctious spirit as a ricocheting romp.\r\n\r\nVaughn, in all his rousing Tarantino-esque tactics, unleashes a visceral assault that is visually wrapped in his escapist package of an adrenaline rush. Wisely, Vaughn incorporates some of his \u2018Kick-Ass\u2019 colourful calisthenics to arm his playful spy yarn. As the veteran spygame squires, both Firth and Caine are game for the frolic they signed up to participate in with puckish aplomb. Jackson brings his usual explosive badass persona to the table as the villainous fashion plate Valentine. The 14 year-old males will draw their adventurous inspiration from Egerton\u2019s junior spy Eggsy Unwin. Some may become nostalgic when uncovering the likes of spotting \u2018Star Wars\u2019 icon Mark Hamill as an imperiled climate changer scientist caught in the crazy clutches of Jackson\u2019s diabolical antagonist. \r\n\r\nAlthough not the most inventive take on ridiculing the spy genre with over-extended finesse and sensationalism, \u2018Kingsman: The Secret Service\u2019 is still a preferred jolting distraction at the beginning of an early stillborn movie season.\r\n\r\nKingman: The Secret Service (2015)\r\n\r\n20th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr. 40 min.\r\n\r\nStarring: Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong and Sophia Boutella\r\n\r\nDirected by: Matthew Vaughn\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy Thriller/Action & Adventure/Fantasy & Action",
            "'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a comedy film that satirises spy movies such as the James Bond franchise. Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by Taron Egerton) is a normal working class 18 year old from London who gets recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Humour comes as he tries to mix with these posh and suave upper-class stereotypes.\r\n\r\nMatthew Vaughn has included his typical ultra stylised violence ('Kick Ass') and it does boast a good sound track. There are a lot of nods to films such as Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but it just reminds me of examples when things have been done much better. The highlight of the film for me was a scene in which Colin Firth violently massacres a crazy church to the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd ('Free Bird') whilst almost seeming like a continuous long shot.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is very unoriginal and the dialogue with the young actors in particular is cringe-worthy. Tarantino type set-pieces just come across as annoying as the film fails to have any cleverness or creativity.\r\n\r\nApart from Colin Firth every actor is either average or just really bad. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, is worse than usual as he tries to add some freshness to his regular spiel by trying to affect an annoying and distracting speech impediment.\r\n\r\n'Kingsman' is going to appeal to the intended target age group as it does contain scenes of fantasy violence depicted as \"cool\" whilst characters swear. It would also help your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen the many, many examples where each scene had been conducted much better.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd",
            "If you like old-fashioned James Bond style movies you probably like this one. It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.\r\n\r\nGary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.\r\n\r\nGary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallell. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.\r\n\r\nThe movie has all the \u201cgoodies\u201d of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent \u201cstuff\u201d like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind\u2019s nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so than the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.\r\n\r\nAll things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned.",
            "**Kingsman reinvents James Bond for a younger generation with enthusiastic, heart-pounding, savage energy.**\r\n\r\nKingsman: The Secret Service bursts onto the big screen with an explosion celebration of all things spy. Matthew Vaughn clearly loves James Bond, Mission Impossible, and Jason Bourne with this youthful, vibrant, action-packed homage to the genre. The gentlemanly charm mixed with the brutal face-paced action and bright, colorful sets feels familiar and new simultaneously. Kingsman tells a coming-of-age tale through the lens of a spy thriller. Kingsman has a fun, fresh, and innovative energy that speeds from beginning to end, telling a simple but engaging story in a delightfully entertaining way.",
            "Despite the fairly experienced cast here, this rather enjoyable rip-off of all things \"Bond\" and \"U.N.C.L.E\" really belongs to the ballsy and engaging effort from Taron Egerton. He is the young \"Eggsy\" who lives with his mum (Samantha Womack) and her gangster boyfriend \"Dean\" (Geoff Bell). After a pretty daring altercation with his goons, the youngster ends up in a police station where he remembers a gift that was given to his mother when his father mysteriously died. He calls a number, is duly sprung and introduced to the dapper \"Harry Hart\" (Colin Firth) who quickly enrols him in a school that isn't for the faint hearted. Survival here is just the start of his adventures as he is quickly embroiled in a world-domination scheme being hatched by gazillionaire \"Valentine\" (Samuel L. Jackson) - aided by his lethal-limbed hench-woman \"Gazelle\" (Sofia Boutella). Luckily he has the sagely \"Merlin\" (Mark Strong) and the versatile \"Roxy\" (Sophie Cookson) to help him - but can he thwart the dastardly plan? Jeopardy isn't high on director Matthew Vaughn's priority lists here, but entertainment and plenty of fun action-escapades are, and they deliver well. Firth is on fine form as the deadly but debonaire mentor; Sir Michael Caine adds a soup\u00e7on of class to the proceedings and Jackson looks like he is having fun in his bright red Converse trainers. It does take just a shade too long to get going, but Egerton works really well as the cheeky chappy with a brain in his head and a solid sense of common decency - particularly useful when he is facing overwhelming odds and doom lies menacingly before him. It's a great looking film, the visual effects are used sparingly and all told this is a characterful, well-written, and good fun yarn that still tips it's hat to the espionage genre - but in a playful and slightly mischievous way. Good fun.",
            "**Another entertaining film about spies.**\r\n\r\nThe British can be proud of their secret services... at least, they are the ones that turn out to be the most appealing for cinema. Not even the CIA has that much attention from the seventh art. Much of this attention comes from the 007 franchise, but there are other films, like the 1998 \u201cAvengers\u201d (not the Marvel franchise) and now this film.\r\n\r\nIf manners make the man, as said in the film, the script makes the film. It all starts when a troubled young man is approached by a gentleman who knew his father, and who offers him a way to change his life and not be a bully. This \u201cblue pill, red pill\u201d moment marks his recruitment into Kingsman, a bizarre private spy agency created behind a renowned gentlemen's tailoring business. They're probably the best dressed and most recognizable spies in the world of fictional espionage. However, soon after becoming a secret agent, he will have to save his agency, and obviously the world, from a villain called Valentine.\r\n\r\nDirected with great care by Matthew Vaughn, the film is a bizarre cross between a common teen film and James Bond. It could be a terrible mix, but this was skillfully considered and based on good quality existing material. In general, I liked the film: it's very entertaining thanks to tons of action and meticulously choreographed fights. There is no shortage of weapons, for all tastes and ammunition, elegant cars and the usual spy gadgets that solve any problem, such as an umbrella that serves as a weapon and a bulletproof shield. The mark of greatest excellence goes, however, to the choice of filming locations and the design of the costumes (whoever made Colin Firth's costumes had exceptional good taste), the sets and props, where technology, creativity and classic style blends very well. The soundtrack, with an epic tone, suits the environment, and the visual effects and CGI are good. A note of warning: the film has some scenes with very graphic content.\r\n\r\nThe film features Colin Firth in another impeccable work, where he shows all his energy and, also, his unmistakable elegance. It was a job that could only be challenging if we consider the action scenes, which he did almost without stunts because, in fact, the character itself is within what the actor likes to do regularly: the typical imperturbable English gentleman. Taron Egerton is young enough for the role and mature enough not to look like just a kid. He does what is needed and ensures decent work, but he is not able to keep up with mature actors. Samuel L. Jackson is an effective villain and seems to be having so much fun with the job that it gives a dark sadistic touch to the way he plays the character. Mark Strong and Sir Michael Caine are equally magnificent additions who fill the film with charisma and impact."

            "**Highly entertaining Bond movie**\r\n\r\nSurprisingly serious Bond movie has Roger Moore step up to the plate for the last time as 007 - this time tackling none other than a psychotic Christopher Walken.\r\n\r\nOne of the better entries, this film has it all - action, humour, beautiful locales, sexy ladies, a scary villain, great stunt work, a classic theme song and of course, the legendary Roger Moore as James Bond.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame that Barbara Broccoli threw all of this classic Bond fun down the toilet in 2006. Bond has always been silly and, sadly, the 2006 reboot has thrown it all away and has no rewatchbility.",
            "Not as good as the previous four, but still a solid Bond film with Christopher Walken, Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones\r\n\r\nA mission in wintery Siberia leads Agent 007 (Roger Moore) to globetrot from England to Paris to San Francisco and Silicon Valley investigating a horse-racing scam and the psychopathic entrepreneur, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), who schemes to flood Silicon Valley for the purpose of creating a global microchip monopoly.\r\n\r\nThis was Moore\u2019s last of 7 Bond films from 1973-1985 and it\u2019s a solid Bond flick, just not up to the exceptionalness of the previous four films: \u201cThe Spy Who Loved Me\u201d (1977), \u201cMoonraker\u201d (1979), \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d (1981) and \u201cOctopussy\u201d (1983). Just as \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d toned down the excesses of \u201cMoonraker,\u201d so \u201cA View to a Kill\u201d (1985) scales things down after the ultra-action-packed adventures of \u201cOctopussy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs such, the movie focuses a little more on the psychological drama of intrigue and rivalry. For instance, there\u2019s a long sequence at Zorin\u2019s impressive chateau and a horse racing scene that\u2019s reminiscent of the low-key golf game in \u201cGoldfinger\u201d (1964). Despite this direction, there\u2019s still a lot of action, like a thrilling ski chase in Siberia, a murder/chase at the Eiffel Tower & Paris, a brouhaha at a mansion, a fiery elevator shaft episode, a wild vehicle chase through the streets of San Francisco with a fire engine, an extended clash in Zorin\u2019s mine complex near the San Andreas fault and a thrilling climax at the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n\r\nOn the female front, Tanya Roberts is just stunning and has a couple of quality scenes. A year earlier she did \"Sheena\" where she had to thin down to fit into a skimpy animal-skin bikini (although she still looked great). Meanwhile Grace Jones is a formidable villainous with an interesting story arc. Mary Ann Catrin Stavin also has a quality cameo in the opening teaser.\r\n\r\nI shouldn\u2019t close without mentioning critics\u2019 denouncements of Zorin\u2019s psychopathic actions in the mines. I don\u2019t get these whiney criticisms, are Bond villains supposed to be nice guys or something? Zorin is mad and this is what megalomaniacal whack jobs do!\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",
            "Walken, right, you can sit back and watch A View to a Kill because of Walken.\r\n\r\nBut let's be honest, he is the ONLY reason that you can sit back and finish this. The 70s, by 1985, were long over and Moore was clearly the 70s era 007. The mood, the atmosphere, the silliness, the feel of 007 needed to change and we still had 70s Bond in 85.\r\n\r\nAnd then, Moore himself looked kind of like Bond in his 70s. He was far too old for the role. Too old to be believable as a super spy. Too old fit the part, and needed to pass on the mantel a few films ago.\r\n\r\nBy 85 the Silly Bond Era needed to end. They needed a new 007, and this, and Moore, just didn't work any more.",
            "They tried hard to make this the worst movie ever.\r\nThey at least made it the worst Bond movie ever by not only making it dull, without motivation, without strategy, without inspiration, without wit, but also by giving it the dumbest title ever (what is a \"view to a kill\"?) and the absolute worst theme song ever.\r\nA theme song that sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard, and that's the truth. It's the worst song Duran Duran ever did. It might be noted that no male artist should ever do a Bond song. The results are terrible. But it's mostly because the songs are written for a product instead of being inspired. \r\nNow, the story. Well, it begins with the issue of poorly bred horses being genetically maneuvered, which mirrored the actual events of the time, as it was during the later 80s when a very covert faction in Kentucky had closed meetings for an Equine club.\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, some genetic engineering was obviously going on with the thoroughbreds. Six furlong sprinter Mr. Prospector was a big zero as a sire for the 10 furlong derby distance until the Equine club perfomed some covert acts. Either by genetic engineering or by early surgery to change the structutre of the Prospector foals. You see, Mr. Prospector was a Kentucky bred horse owned by the biggest farm in Kentucky.\r\nWell, that idea appears for a second in this movie, and is then never explained again, as if some big shots int he industry hushed it up. \r\nMeanwhile, Bond is paired with a plain Jane and the hot girls all get killed, to appease the female audience, and since about 1970, movie makers realized it was the women who decided what movies the family would watch in theaters.\r\nChristopher Walken is poorly used in this movie. He really doesn't do much. He's just an evil villain. There isn't any motivation to speak of for any of the characters.\r\nA lot of bang and boom that just gets dull and dumb. It's full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",
            "Roger Moore's last outing as 007 is his weakest. This story that Christopher Walker \"Zorin\" plans to dominate the world micro-chip industry by destroying California's silicon valley takes the franchise just a shade beyond credible. Whilst Grace Jones\u2019 \"May Day\" is lithe and beautiful, she has no subtlety or panache and Walken hasn't the script or the charisma to do justice to his role as the megalomanic industrialist. Moore tries his best, and with early appearances by Patrick Macnee there is a semblance of some of the style of films gone before; but as it develops this is all - except, perhaps, the \"butterfly act\" about large scale photography and product placement. Duran Duran & John Barry got a Golden Globe for the title song, but that is probably the only highlight for me...",

            "I fully understand that Christopher Nolan is trying to play with time, as that what's the movie's about - and yes, he is known for confusing movies - but here, Nolan has made something uninteresting. The idea of things going backwards is cool, but the rules are unclear. We never know what the basic goal is - I could understand secrets, but the film has to be interesting and 'Tenet' simply isn't. Nothing here makes me want to work things out; it's forgettable. Sure, you can say this has to be seen on the big screen, but the long runtime makes it unappealing to most mainstream audiences. Unfortunately, 'Tenet' is not here to save the 2020 box office. I work at a cinema, and to say it underperformed well would be correct. We are going to see more 'Tenet' hot-take YouTube videos than thinkpiece/what you missed ones. Christopher Nolan has made his most forgettable film to date - it's not a bad movie and I'm sure his diehard fans will adore this one, but for everyone else, there isn't much here. 'Tenet' won't be remembered as another \u201cgroundbreaking visual spectacle\u201c from Nolan or for \u201csaving cinema\u201c. It will be remembered for its weird release schedule and having been shown during a global pandemic, and that's unfortunate. Like the rest of the year, 'Tenet' is a write-off.\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-tenet-time-runs-up-like-my-enjoyment-of-nolans-latest-film",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan has delivered some of my favorite movies of the century. All the way from Memento to the most recent Dunkirk, I've yet to dislike one of his films, so expectations are always high with him. The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called \"cinematic experience\", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.\r\n\r\nNowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I'm not surprised that the \"savior of cinema\" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn't have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it's intended to hype its own movie, so I don't really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, \"savior of cinema\" doesn't mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It's just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It's a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there's a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.\r\n\r\nI'll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.\r\n\r\nNolan said that Tenet would be \"the hardest movie to cut\" for any editor. Jennifer Lame's editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It's relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She's incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I'll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.\r\n\r\nFinally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it's indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It's probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that's only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.\r\n\r\nStory-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn't mean that it isn't a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I'm not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it's a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can't have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.\r\n\r\nThe need to be vague about plot details doesn't let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that's one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there's an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It's a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it's almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.\r\n\r\nThis last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what's happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character's circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled \"Action!\", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled \"Cut!\". Washington isn't exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn't help him through these moments.\r\n\r\nHowever, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn't avoid the \"humorless\" review headlines, and being totally honest, it's surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it's through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington's character traits.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that's what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he's ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called \"blockbuster of the summer\" that everyone deserves this year.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema's riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame's seamless editing, passing through Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's powerful score and Nathan Crowley's beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn't help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn't the \"savior of cinema\" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone's been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "There is a moment midway through this film where you can suddenly feel everything clicking into place. Up until this point, the film has been entertaining, with some great set pieces and a scope that is trademark Nolan, but the central hook of the film - \u201ctime inversion\u201d - has felt almost superfluous to the plot, albeit a clever visual conceit that gives the film a different vibe to your average spy thriller. But then comes the \u201cmoment\u201d - a simple act of crossing a threshold - where suddenly you realise how the visual conceit is going to figure into the rest of the film and also how most of the first hour has been pure setup for what is to follow. It\u2019s the kind of twist that isn\u2019t really a twist at all as it is a visual explanation that the film has really been waiting for. Nolan has taken quite a gamble in delaying this \u201cmoment\u201d for so long and there is always the feeling the film is hiding elements of the plot in the first half. This means the explanation may have come too late for some to invest in the film fully, but if you are still with it, there is a sudden feeling of exhilaration of knowing to an extent some of what is about to follow and the film lets loose with some fantastic set pieces that are hugely satisfying if you have been paying attention.\r\n\r\nPerformances are great, with Branagh in full scenery chewing mode and the score is suitably Zimmeresque and loud. It doesn\u2019t quite hit the highs of its closest cousin - Inception - but it\u2019s scope is similarly impressive and it\u2019s going to lead to plenty of theories and explanations in order to follow each major character\u2019s journey through the film. Great stuff in the end, but it was touch and go there for a while.",
            "I was recently asked if this was better or worse than Inception. \r\n Personally, I don\u2019t think you can compare any of his films outside the fact that he made them.

More precisely, the laws of science are unchanged under the combination of operations (or symmetries) known as C, P, and T (C means changing particles for antiparticles. P means taking the mirror image, so left and right are interchanged. And T means reversing the direction of motion of all particles: in effect, running the motion backward). The laws of science that govern the behaviour of matter under all normal situations are unchanged under the combination of the two operations C and P on their own. In other words, life would be just the same for the inhabitants of another planet who were both mirror images of us and who were made of antimatter, rather than matter._\r\n\r\n>_If the laws of science are unchanged by the combination of operations C and P, and also by the combination C, P, and T, they must also be unchanged under the operation T alone. Yet there is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behaviour is never observed in ordinary life._\r\n\r\n>_The explanation that is usually given as to why we don't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system, disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy's law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round._\r\n\r\n- Stephen Hawking; _A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes_ (1988)\r\n\r\n> _Imagine you and a friend decide to go to Pisa, with one of you standing atop the famous leaning tower and the other located down at the bottom.

And it seems to me watching this overblown mess of a film that Nolan has become so fixated on the grandiosity of the pen that he has completely overlooked the humble pencil. More so than any of his previous work, _Tenet_ is focused on mixing philosophy and real(ish) science with over-the-top mainstream entertainment to such an extent that he ignores such basic narrative principles as character arcs, empathy, motivation, and interiority. Now, don't get me wrong, I love filmic experimentation (two of my favourite directors are Terrence Malick and David Lynch), but _Tenet_ isn't an especially experimental film \u2013 it's a humourless and badly written shambles, convinced of its own portentousness, and created by a man who has achieved such popularity that it seems no one in his circle is willing to tell him when something is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nSpending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time. It's a theme that's front and centre in _Memento_ (2000), _Inception_ (2010), _Interstellar_ (2014), and _Dunkirk_ (2017), and to a lesser extent in _Following_ (1998) and _The Prestige_ (2006) (I haven't seen any of his _Dark Knight_ trilogy so I can't attest to their thematic concerns, and we shall not speak of his remake of _Insomnia_). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, time's arrow, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). Indeed, one of the film's central questions is especially noteworthy \u2013 if what and who we remember from our past defines who we are in our present, do things that haven't happened to us yet also speak to our identity? Do our future actions determine who we are as much as our past actions? It's a fascinating question. And one with which Nolan does precisely nothing. However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.\r\n\r\nThe premise of _Tenet_ is straightforward in outline. The film opens as a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) infiltrates a team of bad guys looking to find a spy at the Kiev Opera House. He finds the man before they do, but during their escape, he sees something which should be impossible \u2013 a bullet seems to travel backwards in space and a bullet hole is \"un-shot\", as if time is reversed for that bullet, even though everything else is moving normally. The Protagonist is able to smuggle the spy outside, but their escape goes awry, and to avoid being captured, he swallows a cyanide tablet. Rather than dying, however, he awakens to be told that he has passed the test to join an ultra-secret international espionage squad known as Tenet. His mission is fairly simply \u2013 at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations. Along the way, he makes the acquaintance of Neil (Robert Pattinson), his infinitely better-informed handler; Andrei Sator (a spectacularly miscast Kenneth Branagh giving new meaning to clich\u00e9d villainy), a dangerous Russian oligarch; Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), Andrei's oppressed and deeply unhappy trophy wife; Priya (Dimple Kapadia), an arms dealer; Ives (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a Tenet soldier; Michael Crosby (Michael Caine), a British intelligence bigwig; and Barbara (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a scientist specialising in all things temporal.\r\n\r\n_Tenet_ is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea (when was the last time a non-franchise, non-comic book original movie got that kind of budget) is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this. The budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, \"they must have spent a lot on catering.\" With _Tenet_, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 vfx shots) \u2013 whether it be our heroes bungie-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse. Even Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's score gets in on the act, employing only melodies which sound the same whether played backwards or forwards.\r\n\r\nAs cinematic spectacle goes (on a purely visual level), I've never quite seen anything like it. It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, \"how the hell did they do that?\"; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Tenet looks like it was an exceptionally difficult movie to make. Along the same lines, the cinematography by the great Hoyte van Hoytema (_The Fighter_; _Spectre_; _Ad Astra_) is stunning, with van Hoytema mixing 15-perf 70mm IMAX film (shot at 1.43:1; projected at 1.90:1) with traditional 70mm stock (2.20:1) and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable (although I saw it on an IMAX screen; aspects shifts would be more obvious on a smaller screen). It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema \u2013 no other artform could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour, and I admire that a great deal. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and _Tenet_ finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the artform can accomplish, foregrounding innovation in ways that big budget mainstream studio productions simply don't, and celebrating the possibilities it affords those with sufficient enough imagination.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems \u2013 most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a clich\u00e9, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times. The idea of saving all mankind simply doesn't pack any kind of emotional punch any more, far better to stay smaller and focus on character.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to those characters. Good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cipher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. But there's nothing more to him \u2013 he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. I'm not a huge fan of Washington in general, who I feel has played every part in the same sombre, disinterested manner, so there could be some prejudice at work, but I am a huge fan of Branagh, and he's even worse. Think of the most clich\u00e9d Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person \u2013 he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clich\u00e9s, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was \"that accent is hilarious.\" Pattinson's Neil and Debicki's Kat fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people; they're gears in the machinery of Nolan's plot.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is _obliged_ to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in _Tenet_, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.\r\n\r\nAt one point early in the film, Barbara tells The Protagonist, \"_don't try to understand it, just feel it_\", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. _Tenet_ is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike _Memento_ (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, _Tenet_ offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's a twist towards the end that I literally saw coming from about 10 minutes in, but aside from that, there's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is instead of trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void \u2013 all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core.",
            "I believe Tenet is very underrated. This movie is just too good! The soundtrack, the action, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, and the fact that CGI wasn't really involved much! \r\n\r\nYet it was indeed challenging to understand. However, after watching Dark, I didn't face much difficulty in understanding the plot, as both have a lot in common.  \r\n\r\nNolan's movies aren't there to satisfy you, they are more of something to be felt. I loved Tenet as much as I loved his other movies...",
            "Been a fan of Christopher Nolan's films but this one didn't quite do it for me. One, confusing story that was hard to follow at times (I got the gist), but beyond that, wasn't terribly entertained. Acting was shaky, Pattison was fine but really disappointed with John David Washington, though he's not helped by cliched dialogue. IDK, didn't hate it at all and maybe will revisit it one day, but this is easily Nolan's weakest film to date. **3.0/5**",
            "I\u2019m a bit annoyed I couldn\u2019t understand the first twenty minutes because of the bombastic bass and a bit underwhelmed by the lack of an emotional arc, but all things considered, Tenet is an epic, mind-blowing James Bond film masquerading as a Christopher Nolan film.\u00a0",
            "Nolan's latest movie is one of his worst. An exaggerated film whose only purpose is to complicate the viewer, but I wish he could do it with cinema. These ambiguities are created only by the chaotic and crowded montage and a series of theoretical dialogues, and no cinema is seen in it. Also, we do not see any coherent story during the film and the events of the film do not form a script at all. There is no characterization in the film, the protagonist character is not made at all and is not believable, also the other characters are completely caricatured and extra, also during the film and its artificial communication, not a bit of feeling is created. Aside from the fact that the film does not even come close to form, it is also very beginner in terms of technique, excessive cuts, and sometimes weird and inappropriate! The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible. In general, the film is considered to be a very bad and weak film, which is like a puzzle without a pattern, meaning that after putting the white pieces together, which is not a difficult task, it has nothing to offer.",
            "man, oooh maaann\r\n<blockquote>everything bumps into each other.</blockquote>\r\nF*ck. yes, another <i>time sh*t</i> by Nolan. people seem to hate or despute it, but I am enjoyed the film. \r\nthe inverted fight, so much to hit my brain. u might call me Nolan's b*tch but i am. idc. this shit is liiiitttttt \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. Also: Washington, Pattinson, and Debicki are sexy af.\r\n\r\nGoransson is good. He did an amazing job. After what he did for The Mandalorian, I'm excited what a sound he would build. What a tone is it. But I wished Zimmer would do that.\r\n\r\nBut yeah there are some other things that failed. The dialogues is hard to hear because of the massive soundtracks. How this film has no emotional core. Yes it's just big spectacle to <i>aroused</i> the <i>hornyness</i> for the (time) plot. Understandable. \r\nI loved it (for the sake of new \"time\" plot from Nolan). Cheers mate \ud83c\udf7b \u270c\ud83c\udffd<blockquote><b><i>time runs out</i></b></blockquote>",
            "It was a long time since I watched a new blockbuster movie and, mostly for personal reasons, even longer since I actually reviewed a movie, blockbuster or not.\r\n\r\nI guess this movie is not the most simple one to pick to get my reviews/blogging back on track but there\u2019s not that much new movies to chose from this year with the pandemic and all.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I approached this movie with some hesitation and perhaps with an assumption that I wouldn\u2019t like it since I have an aversion towards time travel in movies and books. It is more often than not that the author gets it more or less spectacularly wrong and it turns into a mess.\r\n\r\nWell, I have to say that, in my mind, this movie was a bit of a mess. I felt confused and found it difficult to follow the various twists more than once. Also, at least in the beginning, the parts about bullets jumping up in your hand instead of falling out because the bullets where travelling backwards in time sounded somewhat unbelievable to me. I can accept something travelling backwards in time but for such a bullet to jump up into someone\u2019s hand, seemingly on command, no I do not think that\u2019s very believable at all.\r\n\r\nOnce I had watched the entire movie to the end, then finally, some of the first parts started to make sense. Personally I don\u2019t like that I spend a large part of the movie wondering what the f\u2026 even if it (mostly) becomes clear towards the end.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to say, it was a quite cool mess.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I quite like the main protagonist. Whether he\u2019s traveling forwards or backwards he kicks ass and he\u2019s intelligent. He is very much a James Bond type of character which I like.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a shitload of action in this movie and it is both well done as well as cool. Of course, with the budget this movie had I would really be disappointed if there wasn\u2019t good special effects in it. However, one thing that made the effects and action to stand out in this movie compared was this concept that for some people, and objects as well, time moved backwards. Watching some of the larger scenes where some explosions where actually explosions and some where implosions. Cars moving both forwards and backwards in car chases etc. etc. I have opinions about the plausibility of that but it looked cool at least.\r\n\r\nFor me the enjoyment of this movie was the main protagonist which I liked and the cool action. The story itself and its rather convoluted (but original I have to say that) time travel concept, well I\u2019m not sure I was (am) too trilled about that except for the fact that it allowed these rather original special effects.",
            "Appreciated this film more than any Nolan film since The Dark Knight. Usually his films aim for high concept but get weighed down by syrupy schmaltz. This one ditches his unconvincing attempts at emotional/philosophical depth and just focuses on the very creative core concept of inverted time. There's no labored soliloquies about the power of love, no epic aspirations of cultural poignancy - it's mainly just a bunch of exposition interspersed between some truly breathtaking visual and audio spectacle like nothing else. \r\n\r\nNolan is an artist first and foremost. His films always have a level of craft that is beyond comprehension for mere mortals like me. And in this one he turns that up to eleven. Honestly, I actually enjoyed the challenging sound design. It reminded me of the film Primer (another time bending mind melter) where the discussions about complicated ideas are drowned out by background noise and music because he knows we won't understand and it's not important anyway. What is important is that we \"feel it\" (as is literally said). \r\n\r\nDon't try to figure it out. Just enjoy that an arthouse abstractionist who somehow gets 100+ million dollar budgets to make quirky stories with set pieces that will blow your mind.",
            "\u2018Tenet\u2019 is clearly Nolan's most ambitious project to date, but the highly packed and complex plot make it difficult to fully enjoy the movies mindblowing rules of time-inversion within a single view.\r\n\r\n8/10",
            "\u2018Tenet\u2019 is clearly Nolan's most ambitious project to date, featuring action scenes we never saw before and with a magnificent score by G\u00f6ransson. The highly packed and complex plot make it difficult to fully enjoy the movies mind-blowing rules of time-inversion within a single view, but the interesting physics and temporal consequences leave you pondering until long after the credits, in which the movie grows on you, making multiple watches irresistible.\r\n\r\n10/10",
            "Tenet on paper is a super interesting that I think I would have a great time with, but the execution fell flat on its face. The entire plot is so purposefully convoluted that it is really hard to follow. Christopher Nolan whips from one scene to another so fast to cram as much exposition in that so many moments just got right over the audience's head. Half the scenes are just exposition dumps with audio so poorly done that you have to read the subtitles the entire time to even understand what they're saying. The acting is all fine in this movie, but I spent so much time trying to understand the film that any mishaps could have gone right over my head. The only redeeming aspect of this film is the fights and heists. These scenes were filmed with incredible precision that really showed off the scope that the protagonist was trying to accomplish. I had a good time with that, but that was few and far between.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Poor_",
            "Christopher Nolan is a crazy and insane person. There is no dispute about this. What Nolan is trying to convey to the viewers is an adventure that is difficult to imagine on your own. It is also difficult to imagine its events and facts. It is also difficult to photograph many moments. Fear that my mind will be distracted by this wonderful drama.\r\n\r\nThe story of the film is about the attempt of some people to stop the end of the world. This person is known in this film as the Protagonist, as he does not know anything about the mission or how to end the world except for one word, which is Tenet, and the meaning of this word will appear through the events of the film, but frankly, the aesthetic of talking about this film lies In penetrating the events and talking comfortably about the events of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe photography was aesthetic with things that neither the mind nor the eye could have expected while you were sitting in front of the screen. The photographic ability in this film exceeded many stages and reached a stage of dazzling. It exceeded the choice of angles or even the duration of the shot. We have different dimensions and a new method in how to photograph.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic of the story is not in asking ourselves what the story is. The aesthetic of the story is in how the story is told and explained. The narrative of the story and the photographic capabilities greatly exceeded the events of the story and anything else in the film, where scientific and physical facts and theories were used that greatly assist in storytelling. They greatly help in explaining the events and how they pass. Events and these scientific theories and physical facts that boggle your mind and drive you crazy have made my eyes stop closing while my time to sleep came.",
            "Fine, but next time with subtitles.",
            "**CONFUSE THE ... CAT!**\r\n\r\nI think this movie will divide viewers into 3 groups:\r\n\r\n1.) The group that thinks that this movie is a flawless masterpiece, like everything Christopher Nolan does, has ever done, and will ever do.\r\n\r\n2.) The group that argues that this movie is a vastly overrated pile of garbage, and who give the movie a lot of hate because they are angry about the brainless praise this movie gets from the Nolan fanboys.\r\n\r\n3.) The group that thinks that this movie had potential and is certainly not \"the worst Nolan ever\" (which is in fact \"Insomnia\"), but still has a lot problems and is way too confusing.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I belong to group 3.\r\n\r\nWhat I certainly like about this movie is that it encourages interesting thoughts about time travel. And you can see how much effort went into the production.\r\n\r\nBut let's be honest: this movie has a lot of problems. A lot of logical holes and inconsistencies. Bad sound-mix. Bad dialogue which lacks build-up. Superficial characters which are hard to care about. Wooden fatuous acting, especially from the lead actor. Bad overloaded script with characters and a story whose only purpose is to serve the pretentious plot line. And A LOT of unnecessary (and maybe intentional) confusion for the sake of confusion.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Nolan overstrained himself with this one. And like actors and even more so producers failed to restrain Nolan from going too wild with his ideas without anyone checking on whether the whole thing would work.\r\n\r\nI didn't hate it - but I didn't love it either. And I wish people would stop praising it as a masterpiece which it certainly is not and admit that the movie has a lot of problems.\r\n\r\nAnd if you have a cat that is moping all day and badly needs to be confused out of its rut and you cannot afford the services of Confuse-A-Cat Ltd., just show it this movie - it'll do the job just fine!"

            "This was the most fun I\u2019ve had watching a movie in a long time. It has everything I\u2019m looking for in a summer blockbuster: nonstop action, amazing soundtrack (best soundtrack of the year), and hilariously funny. Oh and it\u2019s an Edgar Wright film which has never been a let down. I\u2019ve never seen the star, Ansel Elgort, in anything before but I know he was in the running to play Han Solo and now I\u2019m extremely sad he didn\u2019t make the cut \u2013 he even dresses like Solo for most of the film.

            "**Don't mess with this Baby!**\r\n\r\nOne of the stylish film of the year. There's nothing special about the story, but the way it was made looks intriguing. The individual characters, music, stunts, obviously car chases. Not the best role Ansel Elgort has ever played, but in his short, beginning of the career, it quite possibly defines he's ready for the tough roles. Then the British filmmaker known for some wonderful action-comedies, one more addition to his hit kit.\r\n\r\nA youngster who is a getaway car driver for heists, working under a criminal mastermind, is often teamed with a different crew. One of his latest job takes an unexpected twist, leaving his yet to bloom romance with a waitress in peril. His attempt to come out of that, the risk he takes, changes his life forever. The tale ends with an action packed finale.\r\n\r\nThis is the first Kevin Spacey film I'm seeing after all the allegation against him. I blame everyone equally who had let him do it all these years. But that's nothing to do with this film. He was fine as an actor as always. It's just fine to be as one-off film, but the way everything had happened looked like it could have been a great franchise. As of latest news, it is on. The sad part is, all the good characters won't return. Anyway, it is one of the must see from the year T17.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",
            "Extremely stylish, anime inspired superb action film. Edgar Wright knows what he's doing.",
            "Baby (Elgort) is a quiet, unassuming young man, who looks after his ailing foster parent, listens to music both out of his love for it, and a need to block out the tinnitus ringing in his ears that he was afflicted with due to a tragic accident that also took his parents. Baby also has a specific skill set, one that has him doing the bidding of a crime boss Doc (Spacey) to pay back a debt.\r\n\r\nBaby's skill is driving, but not just any driving, the kind of skilled driving that gets Doc's crew of armed bandits away from the scene of bank hold-ups very fast, and then leads crews of police cars on a merry dance, and dodges every trick up their sleeves with a few of his own set to a killer music soundtrack from his iPod.\r\n\r\nWith light at the end of the tunnel, Baby has a chance encounter with cute diner waitress Debora (James), where the chemistry between the two is instant. He sees this as his road to freedom, and a bright new future. This new future is brought to rude halt by Doc who was not yet done with Baby.\r\n\r\nThis film is all about the music soundtrack, and what a soundtrack indeed. With songs like Nowhere to Run by Martha and the Vandellas, to the quintessential driving song Radar Love by Golden Earring, you'll be tapping your toes as well as being thrilled by the action, plus the classy, and slick driving by Baby.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this film are all stand out, relative new comers Elgort, James, and Gonz\u00e1lez do really well in their respective roles. The scene stealing performances by Spacey, Hamm, and Foxx are great in support to Elgort. While Spacey, as he generally does, plays cool, and mellow. Hamm, and Foxx do it with charm, and evil menace as Buddy, and Bats. Jon Bernthal's cameo as the suspicious, and hot-headed Griff was also a delight to watch.\r\n\r\nWritten, and directed by cult favourite Edgar Wright, this film has all the elements that make this a great addition to the tradition of other heist films like Drive, The Getaway, and Heat.\r\n\r\nBaby Driver is probably the most fun I had at the cinemas this year along with Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man Homecoming.",
            "The moment you catch feelings is the moment you catch a bullet. \r\n\r\nBaby Driver is written and directed by Edgar Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort, Jon Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Flea, Lily James and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez. Music is by Steven Price and cinematography by Bill Pope.\r\n\r\nIn debt to a crime boss, a young getaway driver with tinnitus finds himself taking part in a heist that could spell doom for all involved.\r\n\r\nLets get it out the way, I'm a big fan of Edgar Wright, I find him refreshing for still shooting on film. That he has beautiful camera actions and for the fact his cutting is smooth and not a incomprehensible video game mess like so many other action movie directors these days. So obviously I love Baby Driver for sure.\r\n\r\nThe choreography is high quality, the stunt work equally so, while the varied soundtrack (given to us via Baby's personal player) is one of the best in many a year. Cast are bang on form, where naturally they are given a zinger of script to work from (it pays to watch more than once to catch some lines again). While the thrill of the extended action scenes are joyous.\r\n\r\nIt was a film long in gestation for Wright, and you can see he has given it his undivided attention. He may be divisive as per his output, but the monster success of Baby Driver (both critically and commercially) speaks volumes about the quality of the work on show. One of the best films of 2017. 8.5/10",
            "Lots of slick driving and action, but slim on plot, and very unrealistic ending.\r\nNo explanation of HOW he becomes an expert driver.",
            "Baby Driver stands out as a brilliant, unique, and fun piece of cinema art with its outstanding writing, perfect cast, exceptional stunt work, bold colors, and so much more. This movie gets everything right. However, this film's most impressive feature lies in its soundtrack. The music is a character of the movie interacting with other characters - its beats matching and punctuating what is happening on screen throughout the entire film. One of my favorite heist movies and probably one of my favorite movies of all time.",
            "**Overall : Everything about Baby Driver is fresh, fun, and unique. Don't let this one get away!**\r\n\r\nBaby Driver stands out as a brilliant, unique, and fun piece of cinema art with its outstanding writing, perfect cast, exceptional stunt work, bold colors, and so much more.

            "There is an episode of Tales from the Crypt wherein the protagonist\u2019s conscience sounds just like \u2013 and is played by \u2013 Sam Kinison. OH! OH! AAAUGH! This is only slightly worse than tinnitus but still slightly better than Baby Driver, the story of an idiot savant who is the best getaway driver in Atlanta \u2013 with the caveat that he needs to listen to his iPod; when at the mercy of FM radio, Baby (Ansel Elgort) becomes Tyrone from Snatch. Baby suffers from tinnitus. To drown out the ringing in his ears, Baby constantly listens to music \u2013 which is like putting out a fire with gasoline \u2013 even when fleeing at full speed from the scene of a crime. Right. Children, do not play loud music on your headphones while driving a vehicle.\r\n\r\nBaby is in love with a waitress named Deborah. The coffee shop where Deborah works must be worse than the Carson McCullers\u2019s Sad Caf\u00e9; how else can you explain her piss-poor decision-making? Deborah has no problem running away with a guy who 1) she practically just met, 2) like Cameron Diaz's brother in There's Something About Mary, loses his sh*t when someone touches his precious earphones, 3) associates freely with criminals, 4) is himself a criminal, 5) has \u201cevery clean and dirty cop\u201d after him, and 6) constantly puts her in danger (Deborah is willing to wait five years for Baby to get out of jail. She had to make a living somehow during that time, so I guess the cafeteria wasn't so bad after all).\r\n\r\nMaybe it's true that women like \u201cbad boys\u201d \u2013 which Baby most certainly is, regardless of how innocent the movie wants us to think he is. During the third act Baby is directly or indirectly responsible for four deaths; almost five when he uses Deborah as bait to distract the psychopathic Buddy (Jon Hamm). And speaking of psychos, Bats (Jamie Foxx) is basically Motherf---er Jones from Horrible Bosses on crack \u2013 in spite of which he is the only sensible character in the film (\u201cThe driver must be the eyes and ears, not just the eyes\u201d).\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, there is an admittedly funny moment concerning a discussion about the difference between a Halloween (as in the horror film) mask and a Mike Myers mask. Moreover, Kevin Spacey is a delight as always, and to no one\u2019s surprise he and Foxx have the best lines \u2013 or at least the best delivery.",
            "I guess this is one of those movies that you're not supposed to like because meh politics and meh hipster and meh outrage culture and... reasons that really make no sense and are ultimately meaningless.\r\n\r\nAt least that is what a good bulk of the negative reviews say.\r\n\r\nSo let's not talk about meh politics and focus on the movie instead.\r\n\r\nMy wife put it on, and I have never heard of it. I, legit, thought she was talking about Simon and Garfunkel when she started talking about it. \"Do you want to watch Baby Driver?\"\r\n\r\nHonest mistake, she's part Guatemalan, her English isn't all that great... watch, listen to, whatever.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was in the kitchen cooking and I missed the first part... but I was digging the music.\r\n\r\nIn fact I was digging the music so much that I started going to and from the living room, just because the soundtrack was that compelling. A great mixture of old and new.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, and you really want to see that. Both of them can turn a theatrical trick or two when they want to, and it always kind of seems that Spacey always wants to... and the soundtrack.\r\n\r\nAnd then when I finished cooking and we started eating in front of the television, I really started noticing the ringing when the music wasn't playing. And that was irritating... until my wife filled me in on the back story and then it was an \"ah-ha,\" moment of coolness. It was fairly compelling that they did that, and ran with it like they did.\r\n\r\nAnd, I can't be absolutely positive, but it didn't like it had that much CGI, and that is a plus. It looked incredibly real, like the good old days, so even through you are watching a movie filtered through an Ipod... it had an authentic action movie feel to it.\r\n\r\nOver all, it was incredibly enjoyable fun... and that is why you watch movies like this, right? Because they are fun?\r\n\r\nSo, 10 stars, mission accomplished, it was one heck of a fun film.",
            "Like music beats? Like movies? You've never seen the two combined like this before. On the surface, this is an action-heist movie. But look again...with your ears. The visual beats are in time with the soundtrack. It's utterly mesmerising."

            "As a life long James Bond fan I thought this movie was a fitting end to the Daniel Craig era as James Bond.  I did not think it would be possible to top Casino Royale, however I think this movie did just that.  This will cement Daniel Craig's legacy as either the best actor to play James Bond or as an equal to Sean Connery.",
            "This final Bond installment with Craig had the potential to be his best Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\nCinematography, locations, Story, action, and directing.\r\n\r\nThe poor: Rami Malek, the villain, is by far the absolute WORST Bond villain in the history of the franchise. He will literally \"put you to sleep\". Perhaps he was nervous and decided to swallow an entire bottle of Valium before each take.\r\n\r\nLashana Lynch, plays Bond's replacement when he retires. (Nomi) Although her acting was OK, her character is totally unnecessary in the movie, and she gives me the impression that the Producers were more interested in being politically correct\r\nthan making a great film.  They could have cut 30 minutes off this over-length film by simply adding her to the cutting room floor.",
            "I guess there was time to die, and as so many predicted, be replaced with a female Bond of color.  Because... woke.\r\n\r\nBut it is fitting that Craig went out like that, he seemed to be the only man in the world that didn't want to be James Bond.  There was nothing playful about him...\r\n\r\n... he was just miserable, and miserable from start to finish.  I don't see the draw in watching a depressing 007, and I don't see the draw in watching the inevitable new Politically Correct 007 either.\r\n\r\nNeither seem to fit with the franchise.",
            "**No Time to Die ignores all the development and opportunities of the four previous Bond films to deliver a movie that doesn't understand or care who James Bond is at all.**\r\n\r\nI am just so frustrated. Daniel Craig's run as Bond was solid overall, with some of the greatest films of the 80-year franchise and a couple that weren't amazing but still entertaining. But the conclusion to Craig's Bond was poorly written, out of character, and just plain disappointing. No Time to Die was The Last Jedi of James Bond. Long-time Bond fans will hate it, while those who are indifferent to the franchise or have not seen this entry will find it entertaining and possibly thoughtful. But I just don't see it. The writing was awful. The screenplay couldn't find better ways to motivate or shock than killing off characters that had been developed for over a decade. The idea of a new 007 was pitched as intriguing but hardly affected the story and sidelined Lashana Lynch's character altogether. The villains were generic, and their motivations inconsistent at best. And Bond's love for Madeleine didn't fit the character at all. He said and did things that Bond just wouldn't do. One shining moment in a film of disappointments was Ana de Armas as Paloma. Her performance was witty, engaging, and the most entertaining part of the movie. So, of course, she was only given 5 minutes of screen time. No Time to Die was clearly at a loss for what to do and failed to close this excellent chapter of James Bond history with nothing more than a mess of dreadful writing and unsatisfying conclusions.",
            "Damsel in distress.\r\nExcept that's what makes this film stand out as different from other Bond movies. \r\nIt isn't a damsel in distress, but instead a child in jeopardy. 007 finds himself trying to protect the most innocent of creatures.\r\nAlong the way, he goes through some high octane action sequences. And he fights against a villain using genetic engineering in a weird and deadly way.\r\nHowever, the biggest problems here are \"predictability\" and \"horrible directing\".\r\nThe imagery is horrible. Even when there are exotic locales, there is not one cinematic second. It's all dull and tedious.\r\nThe classic 007 films of the Connery and Moore era had cinematic beauty with exotic locales. \r\nIn the era of Daniel Craig, this poor actor has to go through movies where the director can't even make imagery out of the most exotic locations.\r\nWhy even film on locations? This may as well been done in the studio of Mr. Rogers and his neighborhood.",

            "There are many great predictions hinting to future (it is from 1968 - can you believe it?) innovations throughout the movie. I might not have found all them because I keep falling asleep while watching it but I will keep trying to find them all.",
            "I believe that we should call it a modernism show, albeit exhibited in the form of a movie. While it might feel \"boring\", it forces you to rethink what philosophical level that a two-hour film can achieve. The focus on questions about life, intelligence, and time, is worth more attention than the sci-fi part (though the special effect of this movie is already way ahead of its time).",
            "The eighth wonder of the world. Easily 30+ viewings since I was a little kid. Nothing new to say here; simply wanted to add another pair of hands to the ocean of applause for my absolute favorite thing, the only indisputably perfect movie, the answer to the question of Is Life Worth Living, Man's greatest achievement, two thousand one a burger-flipping space odyssey",
            "I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.\r\n\r\nI remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where\u2019s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.\r\n\r\nHowever, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there\u2019s only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.\r\n\r\nIn the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.\r\n\r\nSo,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.\r\n\r\nI hadn\u2019t actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:\r\n\r\nCritics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films \u2014 and one of the most controversial \u2014 Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity \u2014 and folly \u2014 of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called \u201ccritics\u201d are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there\u2019s really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap \u201cthe folly\u201d. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future  than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.\r\n\r\nSure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably \u201cinterpret\u201d the hell out of any movie and \u201cfind\u201d whatever message you want but it is still bullshit.\r\n\r\nWell, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.",
            "_**Inscrutable space science-fiction as cinematic art**_\r\n\r\nThe discovery of an ancient extraterrestrial monolith on the Moon leads to a mission to Jupiter, but the astronauts have unexpected complications with their vessel\u2019s onboard computer, HAL 9000. William Sylvester plays an official of US Astronautics in the first hour while Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play the two functioning astronauts in the second half.\r\n\r\nCreated by Stanley Kubrick (director/writer) and Arthur C. Clarke (writer), \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is an artistic sci-fi film about human evolution, advanced technology, the wonders of space, the routineness of space travel, artificial intelligence and the mystery of extraterrestrial life. It mixes elements of \u201cPlanet of the Apes,\u201d which debuted over six weeks earlier, with aspects of \u201cStar Trek: The Motion Picture,\u201d which came out eleven years later and was obviously influenced by this one-of-a-kind movie. \r\n\r\nIt begins with the \u201cdawn of man\u201d as a curious introduction before jumping forward to the 21st Century, which has been called the longest flash-forward in cinematic history. The depictions of space travel and life-in-space feel wholly authentic. \r\n\r\nBut \u201c2001\u201d is peculiar in that it rejects traditional techniques of narrative cinema and is often a nonverbal experience, which leaves some viewers in awe and others bored. It\u2019s not about conventional thrills, but rather disquieting awe. It\u2019s not easy entertainment, but meditative, transcendent art. The 1985 sequel, \u201c2010: The Year We Make Contact,\u201d is more standard and less ambiguous yet a worthy companion piece. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack mixes classical compositions, e.g. \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d by Richard Strauss, with four creepy modernistic compositions by Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. The parts of the movie that utilize the latter pieces really evoke an unsettling sense of the unknown.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part is the astronauts\u2019 exchange with HAL, which involves almost an hour of the runtime and is the only part of the film that generates a low-key sense of suspense.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe that humankind began as apes (rolling my eyes). But, even if this were true, where did the apes come from? Did they just spontaneously manifest by accident? If so, when? How? Biogenesis is a scientific axiom meaning \u201clife proceeds from life.\u201d So what life form originally created the apes or the simple organisms that supposedly evolved into apes?\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+",
            "I saw it for the first time when I was in middle school. I thought it was the worst movie ever. Then, some time later, as an adult, I rewatched it and was amazed at how wonderful it was. It was so beautiful and magnificent that I could not believe it was made in 1968, and I thought it was an unprecedented and solemn historical work, like Goethe's \"Faust\" in literature, one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema that mankind has ever possessed. First of all, it is a film in which dialogue is reduced to the utmost limit, and even if it had been in black and white, I could have watched it ten times without getting tired of it, regardless of whether I could have endured the \"silence. It's Kubrick's magic that you can watch this film without any annoying sound effects like in \"Jaws\" but with classical music and with your heart rate regulated like in Charlie Chaplin's silent films. I don't know how well this film was received in the U.S. at the time, but in Japan, many people shy away from it, saying it is difficult to understand.",
            "**A magnificent film, with beautiful music and great visuals... but smug, empty and unforgivably overrated.**\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick is, for me, one of those directors who so quickly impresses us with a great film, as it makes us doubt his competence with an absolutely pathetic trash. I know that the director's fans are going to crucify me, but that's how I think, and I even say more: with each Kubrick film I see, I am more convinced that an aura of unjustified \u201ccult\u201d genius has been created around him. I loved some of his movies like \u201cSpartacus\u201d, \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d, \u201cShining\u201d and \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d, but thinking about them and trying to compare them with \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d is strange. They don't look like the work of the same director.\r\n\r\nReleased in the 1960s, at a time when the space race was at its height and when the future of Humanity seemed, more and more, to be outside our planet, the film addresses the question of the evolution of the human species in a \u201csui generis\u201d way: it starts with monkeys and goes to the first contacts with extraterrestrial beings. The film was considered one of the defining milestones of sci-fi as a cinematographic genre, and I believe that this is indisputable. It's also one of the rare sci-fi movies that seems concerned with being scientifically credible, yet not without flaws that a good scientist will spot (and we might not).\r\n\r\nSet in a hypothetical future, the film shows what space explorations and life in colonies made in space and on the Moon would be like. However, it is still ironic that, after the 60s and 70s, space exploration has been so secondary that many questions, even today, whether we really should spend industrial amounts of money and resources on it. The future that Kubrick imagined in 2001 seems, in 2022, even more imaginative and far from happening than when the film was released. However, some things really did happen and are, today, normal: this is the case of video calls and the extraordinary advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nAmong the various merits of this film, we have to highlight the extraordinary visual beauty, the way the director worked with the visual and special effects and the excellent camera work. At a time when CGI was a mirage far from a filmmaker's mind, this film gives us images and visuals that look like they were made this year. The film simply hasn't aged a single day: we have clear images, magnificently crafted light and details, excellent sound effects, a cinematography that makes envy to many 21st century films and, also important, a magnificent soundtrack where \u201cBlue Danube\u201d and \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d stand out, helping to popularize these melodies.\r\n\r\nDespite these indisputable merits, I think this film deserves to be on the list of the most overrated films I've ever seen. And this is due, in good part, to everything else that I didn't say, and which is essential in a good film. Let's start with the absence of a script and horrible pace: for almost three hours, the film drags on unbearably in scenes of great beauty, but with nothing to say. It's truly exasperating. The only moments where the film really gains interest are when the ship's supercomputer turns against the astronauts, and even that segment feels loose, as if the script were a patchwork quilt. The allusions to aliens didn't fascinate me either, it's a regular clich\u00e9 when making a movie set in space. One point that also didn't help is the lack of good actors, or any decent work for them to do, and the fact that Kubrick shows us life on the space stations as if it were a stay in a luxury hotel. And what about the extraordinary sense of arrogant conceit that the film conveys? We are the ones who have to recognize if the film is good, it can't be the film telling us that every minute!",
            "From the opening bars of Richard Strauss's \"Also spracht Zarathustra\" you just know that this is going to be something unique - and that it is. Apes, playing by a puddle - occasionally engaging in some noisy territorial warfare with their neighbours until one morning, this great black monolith appears. Shortly afterwards these creatures have realised that old bones make new weapons - and that these weapons can kill! The next phase jumps forward four million years later to a mission to Jupiter where a crew of five astronauts under the helpful gaze of their \"HAL\" computer are making their way across space. Two of them: \"Poole\" (Gary Lockwood) and \"Bowman\" (Keir Dullea) are not in hibernation and are regularly engaging with there outwardly affable digital companion. It doesn't take the humans long to conclude that \"HAL\" might be both malfunctioning and malevolent, and all of a sudden the life of all the people on board becomes precariously balanced. Is \"HAL\" malfunctioning, or is it fulfilling it's programming and the crew are just not read in? What might that objective be? We know that the monolith has been seen since the apes, what does that mean? What is the symbolism of this perfectly hewn tablet of granite? Kubrick was visionary with this work. It is a tale of evolution, or progress - of intelligence. It doesn't always make immediate sense, but after you've watched it a few times, there are extra ingredients to this potent mix of adventure and intellect that emerge. The ending is a tad surreal for my rather non-lateral-thinking brain, but the trip they take and the trip we take are eventful and thought provoking. Of course, back in 1968 2001 was a lifetime away and obviously none of this came to pass, but if we renamed it 3001 and recalibrated, well I wonder...! Great stuff.",
            "Absolute classic, must see, one of the best scifi movies ever made",
            "This is the most pretentious crap ever made - but is it an amazing film? No. But it is an amazing _**piece of art**_. This is worthy of the label of film, but the label of film is not worthy of this. Kubrick has crafted a stellar and surreal experience, one of the greatest **_pieces of art_** ever made. Why, you ask, do I obtain from referring to this as a film? Because it is simply not, it is an overpowering sensory experience, not a film. If I seem to be losing my point, here is it straight. It\u2019s too good to be a film. I wouldn\u2019t say this is enjoyable, or entertaining, but it is a stunning experience. One of the greatest **_pieces of art_** ever made. I only lost a point because it\u2019s not a film. Kubrick is often critiqued for his icy cold view of human emotion, and this is no different. The most affecting and human sequence in the film comes ironically (spoilers) from the death of a machine. Check this out, it may not be entertaining, but it IS worth it.",
            "Pleasing on a technical level, even with barely anything to grasp story-wise.\r\n\r\n<em>'2001: A Space Odyssey'</em> looks and sounds exquisite, it really is seriously impressive in that regard for a film from 1968. That is, however, the only reason that this gets a passing rating from me if I'm to be totally truthful. The plot itself is rather disappointing, with not much meat on the bones.\r\n\r\nI get it's evidently going for the more artsy approach, made clear by the lack of dialogue/bona fide narrative alongside plenty of ambiguity. It's a Stanley Kubrick film after all, not that I've seen much of his work (this be the first, in fact); moreso what I've heard through the grapevine down the years. There are also a lot of long held, empty-feeling (as intended, I'd imagine) shots that bothered me throughout. It just didn't entice me, that's all. I can still respect it.\r\n\r\nGiven the aforementioned, the cast are basically nonentities - as harsh as that may sound. Douglas Rain does a good job, in fairness, and William Sylvester is alright. I can't say I blame those onscreen all that much, as they aren't exactly given much opportunity to showcase themselves.\r\n\r\nAs has been the case with a couple of other movies down the years, I'm certainly content to file this one with the 'I clearly didn't get it and I'm cool with that' tag. I'm still glad I watched it. I do appreciate it, if only technically, and naturally love that others love it.",
            "Seeing _2001: A Space Odyssey_ on the big screen for the first time is an eye-opener. The vastness of space, the eerily precise shots of the spacecraft, and the careful pacing all come to life in a way a TV could never match. The immersive sound design, from the opening hum to the famous orchestral music, and in particular the equally orchestrated silence filling the cinema, makes you feel like you're part of the journey. Details that might seem faint on a smaller screen are clear and striking here: the textures of the spacesuits, the contrast in colours, and the scale of Kubrick's vision. This unique visual and auditory experience in a cinema is a must for any film enthusiast, as it genuinely lets the film's grandeur and mystery sink in."

            "**2006 - the year they turned Bond into a common soccer hooligan.**\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the film makers - no longer under the watchful eye of the late Cubby Broccoli decided to run away from making James Bond movies. They also cast a short blonde man as 007.  They screwed with the gun barrel and the tone of the once lively, over the top and amusing series was now one of tedium.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's all over for Bond films now unless they decide to make real Bond films again and not this monotonous  and bland rubbish.\r\n\r\nIt's  shame that Cubby was not still around to keep Eon Productions in line and stop them ruining 40 years of hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Potential Kermode",
            "Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nCasino Royale is directed by Martin Campbell and adapted by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis from a story written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini. It's the 21st film in the James Bond franchise.\r\n\r\nPlot finds Craig as Bond, newly promoted to 00 status, he is thrust into the murky world of high financed terrorism.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest series of films to get right, with some of the most committed of fans, is that of the James Bond series. To wit, there will never ever be a Bond film that will appease every fan across the board. The complaints will range from not enough gadgets, too far removed from Fleming's essence, not serious enough and vice a versa: too darn serious. Then there is the usual round of arguments concerning the leading man stepping into the tuxedo, for every Bond fan ready to fight to the death in the name of Sean Connery, I'll find you another prepared to back Timothy Dalton's take on the Martini swigging legend. Once it became clear that Pierce Brosnan had run his course as Bond, bowing out with the super silly Die Another Day in 2002, the pressure for any new Bond, both the actor and the makers, was immense. 2006 and time had moved on, and we live in different cinema times, spy movies are a different breed to what went before, The Bourne Identity had raised the bar. The news filtered thru that Bond was to be rebooted and that Daniel Craig was the man to be Bond. The howls of derision could be heard from as far as the tropical locations so in keeping with a James Bond plot. Too Blonde, too craggy faced, not tall enough, and why reboot a much loved franchise anyway? It was war and the heat was turned up to full.\r\n\r\nCasino Royale still has its critics, but as majorities go as regards a Bond film, this one has the biggest sway. Sure, the Daniel Craig haters will not be bowed, they can't after all lose face after such a vitriolic campaign against his casting, but few, I suspect, can seriously deny Casino Royale is not a magnificent Bond movie. Just a peak at the Worldwide box office figures shows you how well received it was, making nearly $600 million, those are figures that do not lie. The truth is that Casino Royale has almost everything you could wish for from a Bond movie, and a little more. Gorgeous locations, beautiful women and reams of action; where, the stunt department reach new heights. It's also refreshingly in keeping with Fleming's original story, only major difference here is that the makers have upgraded it to a post 9/11 world. There's nods to traditional franchise staples, whilst also neatly streamlining some of the previous film's comedy scene fillers. Smart villain too, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre, complete with creepy eye issue and loyal girlfriend, is a villain not trying to blow up the world because he's mad, but trying to outwit Bond to stay alive! That's great stuff that keeps a Bond thriller alive and well.\r\n\r\nBut for all the energy and pyrotechnics (there's enough in this one film to have filled half a dozen of previous Bond entries), a Bond film can only succeed if the leading man is up to scratch. Thankfully, and joyously, Craig nails it, both in physicality, swagger and raw egotistical aggression. More telling is that Craig's Bond is more human that what we are used too, at one time suave and appearing unruffled, the next, bruised battered and emotionally conflicted. This is a new and rounded Bond, given impetus by Craig's powerful presence. He is helped by Eva Green putting brains and slinkiness into Vesper Lynd, a Bond girl to turn Bond's head in a way not seen since Diana Rigg's Tracy di Vicenzo in OHMSS. Though one of the film's rare missteps is to under write the part. Felix Leiter also gets a quality tune up in the form of Jeffrey Wright, Judi Dench's M kicks arse and Giancarlo Giannini adds a touch of continental class as Bond's Montenegro contact Ren\u00e9 Mathis. Layered over the top is a nifty score by David Arnold, blending traditional Bond flavours with high energy bursts and Phil Meheux's photography brings optical delights in the Bahamas, Czech Republic and Italy.\r\n\r\nOpening with the best chase sequence in the whole franchise and closing with an ultimate Bond moment, this is reboot supreme.

            "Great James Bond movie and perfect debut for Daniel Craig. He may, at least in the last couple outings, resent the role, he makes for a bruiser version of the character. Pierce Brosnan is still my favorite as his movies came out in the 90s (i.e. the years for watching Bond movies), but this was an all around great film, not to mention the lovely Eva Green coming on to the scene. **4.5/5**",
            "_**Daniel Craig debuts as Bond**_\r\n\r\nBased on Ian Fleming\u2019s novel, \u201cCasino Royale\u201d (2006) goes back to the beginning with James Bond (Daniel Craig) earning his 00 status with MI6. \u2018M\u2019 (Judi Dench) then sends Bond after a private banker who funds terrorists (Mads Mikkelsen), which leads to action in Madagascar, a poker game & romance in the Bahamas, thwarting the destruction of a prototype airliner in Miami, a high-stakes tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro and a thrilling finale in Venice. Caterina Murino and Eva Green also appear on the feminine front.\r\n\r\nCraig is more rough-hewn than Pierce Brosnan and more akin to Timothy Dalton, albeit without the smirk. Craig has the gravitas to pull-off the role and is utterly convincing.\r\n\r\nLet's face it, James Bond flicks aren\u2019t that deep. They may have convoluted plots, but there's little character depth and no heavy subtext commenting on the human condition. They're spy thrillers with an ultra-cool protagonist, beautiful women, spectacular locations, amazing gadgets, global political intrigue, gambling matches, wild action and megalomaniac villains. That's it. Yet they're very entertaining, which is why the series has been such a hit since 1962 when \"Dr. No\" was released.\r\n\r\nYet, with the exception of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" (1969), there's very little character depth. Take James himself: Women to him are only meaningful as (1) a sexual dalliance or (2) a means to fulfill his mission. I mention this to point out how \"Casino Royale\" boldly changes this. The film has character depth and shows why Bond is the way he is. For instance, there are a couple amazing conversations between James and his potential woman in the story, Vesper (Eva Green), and they're full of insights. The dialog is snappy & intriguing and the performances are right-on.\r\n\r\nBy the way, someone complained that all the women in Bond flicks are loose and willing to sleep with any man at the drop of a hat. No, they're just willing to sleep with James Bond, lol. I'm not saying it's right, but it does reflect the alluring charisma of the suave Mr. Bond.\r\n\r\nThere are some thrilling action sequences, like the long, unrelenting chase at a construction site after the title credits, but there are also some quality dramatic segments. For instance, the main poker match at the titular casino is well-staged and suspenseful.\r\n\r\n\"Casino Royale\" strikes me as a mixture of the first half of \"Goldfinger\" with the serious tone of \"The Living Daylights\" & \"Licence to Kill.\u201d Don't expect the comic booky approach of \"You Only Live Twice,\" the cartoonish-ness of \u201cDiamonds are Forever\u201d or the science-fiction (and sometimes goofiness) of \"Moonraker.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 24 minutes, and was shot in the Czech Republic, Venice, Bahamas and England.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+",
            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/casino-royale-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Casino Royale is a near-perfect debut of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. This brutal version of the famous protagonist is beautifully interpreted by Craig, who contradicted the naysayers at the time of release and delivers a phenomenal performance as the iconic 007. His witty humor, irresistible charm, and excellent line deliveries find a close match in Eva Green's take of the \"Bond girl\", whose intelligence and strong attitude puts aside any generic, formulaic traits. Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as always as the vulnerable antagonist, but his impact on the overall picture is slightly underwhelming. The action set pieces are worthy of belonging to blockbusters of today, holding impressive stunt work and cinematography. Martin Campbell creates one of those films I can't pinpoint any flaws. Bond fans will feel delighted.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "From the breathtaking stunts in the opening chase to the suspenseful high-stakes poker game, \u2018Casino Royale\u2019 gets everything right, introducing Craig as a tougher, grittier and more realistic Bond. James Bond.\r\n\r\n10/10",
            "As reboots go, this is probably the best I've seen. Daniel Craig takes up the mantle of Ian Fleming's \"007\" in this two-part thriller that starts off at break neck speed and rarely drops below third gear for almost 2\u00bd hours. Having just attained his licence to kill status - after disposing of the double-crossing \"Dryden\" (Malcolm Sinclair), he is now hot on the trail of a courier in an African republic. After a chase of pretty epic proportions that sees them leaping from buildings and cranes before \"Bond\" finally manages to trash an embassy, he obtains a cellphone with just one word. What does it mean? Well now he must use all of his roughly hewn skills to find out - a challenge that takes him via the Bahamas to Miami where he has two thwart a daring attack at the airport on a brand new airliner, that would bankrupt the manufacturer and make someone $100m. That someone is now seriously annoyed - and in quite considerable danger themselves, so phase two of the story starts - and this is where it gets interesting. Off to the beautiful land of Montenegro for the ultimate game of poker. Staked by a rather wary HM Government, he is put in the capable hands of \"Vesper\" (Eva Green) and with the help of local fixer \"Mathis\" (Giancarlo Giannini) faces his new nemesis \"Le Schifre\" (Mads Mikkelsen). Quite literally - winner takes all. The story here is strong, the plot has twists - especially towards the end; there is loads of action, gadgets - a cracking Aston Martin; and loads of glamour. That latter element was largely missing during the Dalton/Brosnan eras for this suave and debonaire super-spy. Craig exudes a classiness about him, and Green likewise as she quickly realises that his is a dangerous business. Mikkelsen makes for a good baddie - so much of his acting is done through his expressions, and here he radiates a sort of measured menace that proves quite effective as the story reaches it's rather painful climax! David Arnold has written a score that nods to the John Barry sweeping and orchestral style of the early films and the writing doesn't waste time trying with the puerile double-entendres that dogged some of the earlier outings for \"Bond\". The one man missing, rather notably, is \"Q\" and \"Moneypenny\" has become a bloke called \"Villiers\" (Tobias Menzies) working for Dame Judi Dench's no-nonsense \"M\". The denouement is as action packed as the rest of it, and it introduces us to the idea that there is an organisation out there guiding so much of the criminal fraternity. A spectre of things to come, perhaps? Let's hope this is a sign of a new and improved vivacity for this tiring franchise. This is a very good re-start.",
            "It honestly wasn't bad and I really hate Daniel Craig as James Bond, he seems to be the only person on earth that does NOT want to be James Bond. And it kind of sucks watching someone play Bond that doesn't look like he wants to be there.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the fact that they rebooted the franchise, and I am not a fan of that either.\r\n\r\nAnd, well, the film had 3 endings didn't it? I mean, literally there were two natural endings but they milked it for a third one. So by the time you get around to ending three you're screaming \"enough already!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it started strong. I mean, it started REALLY strong even for a reboot. And it made the clever move of keeping the same M, and that helped stop the people like me that hate reboots from grumbling too much.\r\n\r\nIt did away with Q and the over-the-top gadgets and, yeah, Python Q wasn't good plus every Bond has his own feel.\r\n\r\nSo what was left was a solid action movie with mostly great acting (especially from the Villains) that was great... up until it SHOULD have ended the first time.",
            "Depressingly predictably Hollywood.\r\nThis is hardly a 007 movie, and can't be called a \"film\". It's just the same Hollywood formula of contriving a story to be as depressing as possible.\r\nThe same formula Hollywood had prided itself on since about 1965.\r\nIt's very dull, and there's no imagery.\r\n007 films once had exotic scenery that was done in a cinematic way.\r\nNo more. \r\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with Daniel Craig. It doesn't matter who plays 007 when the writer and director are control freaks for hatefulness.\r\nIf you can stay awake through the dull scenery and ridiculous lines (Bond even says it doesn't matter what cards you have in a poker game. This movie goes beyond \"retarded\"), then you wonder what the plot is. Bond goes through a kidnapping ordeal and losing in cards, and he's obviously a victim of card cheating, but this genius doesn't suspect that.\r\nThen, we get the predictable ending that is so Hollywood. \r\nThis movie would be the worst Bond movie ever if not for \"A View to a Kill\".",
            "This generally considered the best Bond film and for me it's top 3."

            "Bohemian Rhapsody is not a biography of Freddie Mercury, nor a biopic of Queen. It's a story based on a selection of key events occurring between the formation of the band and their appearance at Live Aid.\r\nAs a Queen fan I found this film utterly engrossing and enjoyable. The acting brilliantly invokes the characters in the band and the music provides a thumping rhythm to carry the story along.\r\nQueen aficionados may be affronted by the out of sequence music performances and the highly selective approach to the story telling but if you can see past that, you'll enjoy a storming film with a spine-tingling conclusion as the Live Aid performance is brilliantly recreated.",
            "Rami was beyond superb at bringing the light that was Freddie to life again. I almost couldn't tell the difference. It was so well done. Perfection. I wish all real life bio-pics could be as heartwarming, heartbreaking, and fun as this. We miss and love you Freddie.",
            "I was scared to see this, mainly because most Biopics paint people in an absolutely horrible light and Queen was one of my favorite bands and Freddie one of my favorite rock vocalists. I was ready to rant and rave if it turned out to be a smear campaign of one of my rock heroes.\r\n\r\nFortunately it wasn't, it was actually a fair treatment of all of them. And, in fact, it was really generous towards May, but then he wasn't the focus of the film.\r\n\r\nAnd the cast actually looked like Queen. So that is a plus. Everyone did a great job and props have to go out to Rami Malek, he would have been great if they gave him actual dialogue.\r\n\r\nSo why the single star? Honestly, it's because of the trailer. As in, if you saw the trailer you pretty much have already seen the movie. Not just the highlights, but the entire movie.\r\n\r\nQueen was an epic band. Bohemian Rhapsody was an epic song. But Bohemian Rhapsody the movie has absolutely no meat on it.\r\n\r\nYou walk in with high hopes, and the cast is great, but the movie as a whole is a let down. It ends at Live Aid (as it probably should) but even then it doesn't seem anywhere near as epic a finale as it should have been for such a memorable and lauded performance.\r\n\r\nUltimately, there should have been more to it.",
            "**A good film about one of the great rock bands of the 20th century.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that was made with the fans of a personality in mind, more than the rest of the public. This, however, is not exactly a problem in my eyes, it is rather a characteristic of this film, common to other biographical films that are centered on very popular figures such as sportsmen, musicians or others.\r\n\r\nDirected by Bryan Singer, the film covers the journey of the notable rock band \u201cQueen\u201d and its lead singer, Freddie Mercury, who immortalized himself with memorable performances and a sense of stage and spectacle that only big stars possess. Mercury was also notable for being one of the first major superstars to openly embrace his homosexuality and die of AIDS. As a biography, it is a very acceptable film and, as far as I was able to understand, it respects the essential aspects of the lives and artistic path of those concerned. Of course, being a film about a rock band, we cannot ignore the soundtrack, where we have the band's most famous and recognizable songs, and we can see a reenactment of the famous live performance they did at \u201cLive Aid\u201d in 1985, a one of the most acclaimed live musical performances ever in rock history.\r\n\r\nObviously, the film was fated to financial success and, without any major surprises, and after weeks of advertising investment, it found great support from the public and became one of the biggest box office successes of that year. Critics also had no major objections and the film arrived at the Oscars as one of the favorites: out of a total of five nominations, it won four statuettes (Best Actor, Best Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing) losing only for Best Film.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in addition to the good songs and good script, the film offers us one of the best performances by Rami Malek, an actor who couldn't be better suited for the role of Freddie Mercury. In addition to all the physical similarities that he took advantage of to embody the character, he managed to interpret him in a dignified and respectful way, without transforming \u201chis\u201d Freddie into a kind of cheap imitation of the real person. However, as I watched the film, I couldn't help but feel that Malek was the only one in the scene who deserved the spotlight, and that the film lacked an equally good supporting cast that would give some charisma to the remaining band members, transformed into in extras in a story where only Mercury was taken into consideration.",
            "There are plenty of opinions as to how authentic this is, as a retrospective on the life of Freddie Mercury; but there can be no doubting that the pairing of Rami Malek and Queen's music makes this a captivating couple of hours of cinema. We are taken on the compelling and enthralling roller-coaster that was his life and the excesses of his lifestyle and behaviour are comprehensively conveyed without being at all graphic, or even particularly seedy. Malek is simply magnificent. Tom Hollander is also outstanding too. I bet it did wonders for sales of Queen music too - they created one hell of a repertoire."

            "A great movie for the whole family. Watch my full review here.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews//the-jungle-book",
            "> The red flower adventure!\r\n\r\nThe Rudyard Kipling's famous children's book was adapted numerous times for stage shows, television series, live-shot and animation films, and now here's the modern version and also the first digital 3D version. The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading/listening/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.\r\n\r\nNeel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.\r\n\r\nThe CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.\r\n\r\nThe story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.\r\n\r\nI mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.\r\n\r\nSo aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.\r\n\r\nThe film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.\r\n\r\n8/10",
            "I had only one true issue with Jon Favreau's _Jungle Book_, and while it does seem like sort of an unfair one, it's also a pretty huge one.\r\n\r\nFor months before I got the chance to see this remake, I heard non-stop about what a great actor the kid playing Mowgli was, how photorealistic all the animals were, and how you would never be able to guess that the backgrounds were all actually sound stages that had been animated over. Well I just watched _The Jungle Book_, and I found all three of those compliments to be patently untrue. That might sound like three issues, but in reality they all boil down to the same one thing, suspension of disbelief. Or more accurately, the lack of it. From the word go, there wasn't s moment that I found myself being continuously drawn out of the story because of one of those reasons (usually the look of the creatures). I was not once able to fully engage, and though I recognise that from a plot point of view, this version was even better than the 1967 one, I still found myself constantly aggravated by the harsh meshing of Mowgli against the world around him.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._",
            "This is without a doubt a very good family movie. Many people seem to compare it unfavorably with the \u201coriginal\u201d animated movie from Walt Disney. To me these are quite different movies and should not really be compared. I have not read the book but I have a feeling that this movie follows the book more closely. It is a wee bit darker, more serious and incredibly beautiful to watch.\r\n\r\nI quite liked the original jungle book movie. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I am therefore quite happy that this was not just a \u201cdumb\u201d remake with modern CGI and that I quite liked this take of the classic story. This movie is, as I wrote, much more serious and a wee bit darker. It is less of a children\u2019s movie than the original.\r\n\r\nThe wolves are getting much more time in this movie which is good. Mowgli\u2019s opponents are also much less comical and much more sinister. Kaa is a beastly snake with no remorse, King Louie is a huge, scheming, and tyrannical ape King and finally Shere Khan is a ruthless, human hating,\u00a0tiger that kills anyone or anything that stands in his way.\r\n\r\nThe CGI is top notch as far as I am concerned. The jungle scenery is absolutely stunning and it is really worth watching the movie just for the scenery. Combined with a classic adventure story that is not half bad makes\u00a0for a\u00a0really a good movie.\r\nI was definitely positively surprised by this movie. For me it is a big success.",
            "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version.\r\n\r\nI don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it.  From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects.  Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes.  The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?).\r\n\r\nIf anything, I think the writing took a hit.  Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli.  And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning.  I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing.  I could, but I'd have to do it different ways.\r\n\r\nAnd in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a \"take charge\" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points.\r\n\r\nUltimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",
            "An uneasy truce between the wolves and tiger \"Shere Khan\" becomes tested as \"Mowgli\" (Neel Sethi) gets older and harder to keep safe. Pre-empting things getting even more dangerous, they send him under the guardianship of the panther \"Bagheera\" to the nearest man village where he can grow up with his own kind. What now ensues are some engaging adventures through the jungle where he meets the clever bear \"Baloo\" - who knows how to get his honey supply sorted out; \"Kaa\" - the devious snake and, of course, the Kong-esque \"King Louie\". Now \"Mowgli\" isn't exactly sold on the man village thing, and the more he spends time in the forest with it's critters the less he wants to spend time with his people. Can \"Baloo\" and \"Bagheera\" deliver him in one piece? \"Bare Necessities\", \"Trust in Me\" and \"King of the Swingers\" add a bit of hypnotising and toe-tapping to a rather creatively animated story that merges the plentiful CGI with the live-action scenes really well - especially at the conflagration that is imaginatively created with quite a bit of menace and, of course, a nod to the healing balance of nature. Sethi has something of the Sabu to his performance. It must have been difficult for him to work with so much green screen, but he still manages to inject a degree of natural characterisation into his efforts - especially with the pesky bees and the even more pesky apes. It's not a great film for television - if you can see it at a cinema, then the photography and creativity accompany Roald Dahl's story of friendship and loyalty enjoyably."

            "To Mamma Mia! then, a movie easily slipping in past Coyote Ugly as the second-worst film I've ever seen (behind The Rocky Horror Picture Show). My eyes. I can't unsee it.\r\n\r\nFrom what I could gather (and that's not because the plot is difficult - Christ, no - or because I wasn't really paying attention, it's because the film seemed to be not sinking in, not digesting in my brain. I think my brain was trying to reject it, like a foreign object) - an airy-fairy middle-aged bohemian tart (Meryl Streep, The Iron Lady) prances and dances around her primary-coloured villa on an unspecified Greek (I think) island. Her equally airy-fairy \"Barbie Princess\" daughter (Amanda Seyfried, Les Mis\u00e9rables) prances and dances around with her. That seems to be what they do. I mean, for a living, like. They're not on holiday. This is the summation of their lives. Idyllic and unrealistic prancery and dancery, around a villa apparently coloured in by over-enthusiastic first-graders. They have two friends each who escort them everywhere - even to the sh!tter perhaps, I dunno - who exist exclusively to orbit like satellites around this main pair. In fact, everybody in this movie exist purely to serve the life stories of Streep and Seyfried. It's that sort of film, where everybody on-screen is wondering, \"Oh! Will Streep eat a tangerine next? Or a satsuma? Will Seyfried brush her hair with a soft brush, or a slightly-softer-than-that brush? Oh, the agony!\" Anyway, the daughter's getting wed - the next day, I think - to some impossibly perfect young lad (to suit her impossibly perfect everything else), but, oh noes! She never knew who her dad was, because her mum was a dirty old stropper back in the eighties, and they've both been too busy prancing and dancing for two straight decades to even have brought it up, ever! So, who will give her away tomorrow? Oh noes!\r\n\r\nWell she prances and dances her way to her mum's secret diary (with her two conjoined mates, obvs) and, equally \"obvs\", it's all in there. Ta-daa! Except, there are three possible \"daddies\" and of course, they are Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye) and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest). So she invites all three to the wedding under the pretense of being her own mum and of course all three drop whatever they've been doing for twenty years and turbo their way, immediately, to this island, all arriving together, on the same boat, which also belongs to one of them. Hurrah. From there, much \"hilarity\" ensues as the airy-fairy daughter tries to suss which one's her dad while her airy-fairy tart mother spends the rest of the film - with HER conjoined mates, obvs - wondering whether to let Brosnan \"tap dat ass\" one more time.\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT (LIKE ANYONE GIVES A DRY, UNYIELDING BUMPLOP): They don't find out who the daddy is: the three pinhead blokes all agree that they now already love this silly airy-fairy daughter so much that they agree to be one-thirds daddy each. Then, out of the clear ****ing sky, the airy-fairy daughter tells her groom at the altar that the wedding's off, and they should just prance and dance around the world instead. Fantastic! And not to waste a wedding full of perfect ****ing strangers anyway, but Brosnan decides to marry Streep while they're there. Well of course. And Skarsg\u00e5rd hooks up with Julie \"Isn't she dead yet?\" Walters - one of Streep's conjoined mates - and Firth, who as it happens was a left-footer all along who was just experimenting with Streep back in the day, cops off with a waiter in traditional Greek island fashion. Hurrah for everything! Let's have another ABBA song, eh?\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nOh, the ABBA songs. I mean, there are musicals. Then, there are musical musicals. And then, way past any of that, there is Mamma Mia!. A quick Wiki-up shows me that, excluding reprises and a deleted scene, there are twenty songs performed in Mamma Mia!. So, say, four minutes per song, that's eighty minutes. Wiki (again) tells me that the film is 109 minutes in length, so let's knock off ten minutes-worth of credits, and you're looking at eighty minutes of singing in a 99 minute film. That sounds about right. A 19-minute story - a p!ss-poor one, at that - stretched over an hour-and-a-half by the soothing tunes of Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn and Anni-Frid. Looking at those numbers I'm now somewhat impressed that whilst watching this pile of pooey bum-leavings I didn't stand up, lose the plot, smash my house to rubble and wander off to live in the woods as a sasquatch. It was ceaseless. An ABBA song, three lines of dialogue (if you were lucky, which wasn't often), another ABBA song. Over and over. And... well, the songs were all sung in-camera by the actors. And whilst I wouldn't call any of them good singers, they could all at least hold a note (only just in Streep's case, but she managed to stumble over that line).\r\n\r\nAll except Pierce Brosnan.\r\n\r\nOh, Pierce. Pierce! Why didn't someone tell him? Did no one care enough? Is he THAT unlikeable? Why couldn't he hear it himself? I don't want to come across as either xenophobic or stereotypical when I suggest that he sounded like a drunken Irishman preparing to fight, but that IS what he sounded like. And who knows, maybe that's what was really happening with him at that time. He IS an Irishman, perhaps he needed to get good and liquored up before the singing - I know I would - and perhaps he was wondering whether or not to attack the first person on the set who dared laugh. Sounds perfectly plausible.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the whole thing's a travesty, top-to-toe. Most closely resembled one of those straight-to-video Barbie movies, beloved of six-year-old girls and nobody else on the entire planet. If you ever have an opportunity to see it, DO NOT take that opportunity. SPURN that opportunity. Spurn as though your very life depended on it. That's all the advice I can give. Don't do what I did, and watch Mamma Mia!. Only madness lies that way.",
            "Really enjoyable film, with a lot of funny one-liners, and despite the fact that a lot of them are rubbish singers, that partly adds to the humour, and obviously, Amanda, Meryl, Colin and others do have good voices :)",
            "***SPOILERS AHEAD***\r\n\r\n_Mamma Mia!_ is an American-British romantic comedy musical directed by Phyllida Lloyd. The movie is loosely based on the original London musical also directed by Lloyd, and was the brain child of Judy Craymer who was convinced ABBA songs could be used in a theatrical production, especially after hearing the love ballad _The Winner Takes It All_. Craymer along with British playwright Catherine Johnson also worked on this film. Johnson being the original musical's scriptwriter wrote the movie's script, Craymer was an executive producer alongside Gary Goetzman as well as Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe film stars Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Amanda Seyfried, and Christine Baranski.\r\n\r\nSet on the idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi it tells the story of Donna Sheridan (Streep) an independent manageress and owner of her own hotel. Donna has a 20 year-old daughter by the name of Sophie (Seyfried) who is getting married to Sky (Cooper). Upon finding Donna's old diary Sophie discovers that there were three men: Sam Carmichael (Brosnan), Harry Bright (Firth) and Bill Anderson (Skarsg\u00e5rd) and learns that one of them could be her father. She decides to invite all three of them to her wedding. \r\n\r\nSophie later reveals this to her friends Ali (Rachel MacDowall) and Lisa (Ashley Lilley) who have agreed to be her bridesmaids. Donna has invited her old friends/bandmates Rosie (Walters) and Tanya (Baranski) to the wedding to help her out. She is however completely unaware of what Sophie has done and is taken by surprise when Sam, Harry and Bill arrive on the island. This causes Donna to have a mid-life crisis, and it is up to Rosie and Tanya to lift her spirits. While at the same time Sophie bonds with the three men, and discovers she has a trait from each of them. Things get complicated when all three men agree to give Sophie away, and realizing the mess she created she faints at her own bachelorette party.\r\n\r\nThe next day Sophie runs into Donna who is convinced that she wants the wedding called off. This causes Sophie to yell at Donna, and openly states she wants to avoid all the mistakes Donna has made in her life. At the same time Donna is pursued by Sam, the two realize they still love each other but are too busy for each other. Meanwhile, Tanya is courted by Sky's friend and best man Pepper (Philip Michael) despite the fact that he is old enough to be her son. Sophie then runs to Sky and admits what she did, angry and hurt Sky runs off. At the same time Sam tells Sophie that marriage is not always a happy thing.\r\n\r\nSophie then runs back to her mother and asks her to help her dress for the wedding, Donna is delighted and they mend their relationship. Sophie then learns that Donna was disowned by her mother when she got pregnant, she then proceeds to ask Donna to give her away. Donna happily agrees and as the two prepare to go to the chapel she finds herself accosted by Sam. Sam demands to know why Donna will not explain why she won't talk about their relationship. Donna then says she still loves him despite her better judgement and the fact that he broke her heart by being engaged.\r\n\r\nDonna then proceeds to run into the chapel where the wedding finally begins. As the ceremony begins Donna realizes that she can't hide the fact that the men are there. She then introduces Sophie's dad, but then learns that Sophie invited all three of them. They then all decide to be a third of her father, Sophie surprised decides to call off the wedding. Prompting Sky to run away with her and sail the world. Sam meanwhile decides that the wedding should not go to waste, despite Donna's protest at bigamy. After revealing his divorce Sam pops the question, hesitant Donna accepts it. At the wedding reception Rosie falls in love with Bill, who at first rejects her advances but then ends up loving her too.\r\n\r\nThe movie closes with Donna and Sam alongside Bill and Harry bidding Sophie and Sky farewell as they sail away from Kalokairi. Donna, Tanya and Rosie then reprise _Dancing Queen_ during the end credits, and then the rest of the cast appears and they all sing the song _Waterloo_. The movie then finally ends with Sophie singing _Thank You For the Music_ during the end credits.\r\n\r\nTold using several popular ABBA songs including_ Honey, Honey, Honey_, _Dancing Queen_ and the iconic titular song _Mamma Mia_ this movie soundtrack is responsible for making ABBA's music hit the charts again. Albeit some bad singing (cough)Pierce Brosnan(cough) the soundtrack is wonderful. The movie has some references to other films including _Dirty Dancing_ and _Grease._ Meryl Streep's performance of Donna Sheridan is an amazing example of her versatility especially when she sings the love ballad \"The Winner Takes It All.\" \"S.O.S\" is an interesting scene Brosnan's voice is flat but judging by his body language he is enjoying himself.\r\n\r\nIf you ignore the bad singing, you will be able to enjoy this film. I highly recommend it and the soundtrack. However, due to royalties and disagreements with UNICEF UMG and Decca Records could not secure the rights to the song _Chiquitita_ which explains why it is not on the CD.\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen this movie, then what are you waiting for?! Stream it or buy it and do it before July 20 because that is when it's highly anticipated sequel hits theaters!\r\n\r\n> It's very Greek! - Rosie",
            "**With a good cast and an enviable and appealing soundtrack, the film promised to be excellent\u2026 but it turned out to be much more average than I imagined.**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I think I need to make a note: I can't say that I'm an ABBA fan, but the truth is that I have a great affection for the band and their songs, because they were songs that I remember hearing on TV when I was a kid. It is a childhood memory, which has a sentimental charge, and which cannot be evaluated in a completely neutral way (childhood memories never leave us neutral).\r\n\r\nI have yet to say that I had high expectations for the film. I'm not just talking about the music and the various songs I remember listening to, but also the enormous quality of the cast selected for the project, and the active participation of elements of the former band in the production. It was something that promised to have great quality. Well, the film has its qualities, it's undeniable, but the truth is that I noticed some laziness and sloppiness in the production, in several aspects.\r\n\r\nThe film's biggest problem was the absence of a well-written script that could support the action and songs. In addition to the slew of summer movie clich\u00e9s, the script copied an old Italian movie called _Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell_, whose action is based on the dubious parenting of the protagonist's daughter, played by Gina Lollobrigida. I cannot say that we are in a situation of plagiarism because there are many films about children that do not know their parents, but the lack of originality is remarkable. Also, the film seems to almost make the apology of sexual promiscuity! In the midst of an uncomplicated, light, \u201chippie\u201d environment, the film puts the main character\u2019s mother in an embarrassing situation: she is the single mother of a daughter who grew up not knowing her father because there are three possible \u201ccandidates\u201d, with whom she got involved almost simultaneously! And I'd rather not talk about that scene where a mature woman flirts with a guy much younger than her!\r\n\r\nJumping from Broadway to Hollywood, Phyllida Lloyd assured a sincere, but not excellent, effort at the direction. She was not able to demand more from her crew, she allowed a very poor conception of the characters and the choice of actors was not at all happy from the moment they had to sing. The best choices were Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep, two solid, charismatic, expressive actresses with an excellent voice. The scenes in which the two are protagonists, speaking or singing, are among the best in the film, which was an excellent bet that Seyfried made in her career. Stellan Skarsgard did reasonably well, but I felt he had little to do, and so Colin Firth... in fact, this English actor, whose voice is not particularly pleasant, already seemed to me to be a dubious choice for a musical. However, he looked like an opera diva when compared to Pierce Brosnan or Julie Walters. The ex-Bond has great difficulty with the treble and sings almost in falsetto, and Walters can't sing without starting to scream.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film isn't brilliant either. On the positive side, we have the elegant cinematography, with the sun, the sea and the scenic beauty of the Greek islands favoring the visuals (we have to agree that the filming locations were wonderfully used), as well as the well-conceived sets and costumes. But the film's strong point is the soundtrack, of course, with an abundant list of ABBA songs, so famous that we can sing the entire movie. However, the insertion of each song in the film leaves a lot to be desired, something that, along with somewhat artificial choreography, leaves us with the feeling that the film is almost a gigantic music video clip, with the script being just an excuse for the songs to appear successively.",
            "How can anyone not like this? Phyllida Lloyd has managed to convince half a dozen serious A-list stars to take part in this Mediterranean musical extravaganza. Meryl Streep and Christine Baranksi are cracking and Julie Walters - when the three together sing \"Chiquitita\" is glorious. Sure, it's not a wonderful piece of classic cinema; but it must bring a smile to your face (even if - as Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd or Colin Firth break into song, it's more of a grimace). Dominic Cooper makes a valiant effort as \"Sky\" who is to wed the orchestrator of this whole predicament \"Sophie\" (Amanda Seyfried) who has invited the three men to her wedding in the hope that she might find out which of them might be her father. If you don't like ABBA and musical theatre, then don't waste your time; otherwise this is just good fun!"

            "**2006 - the year they turned Bond into a common soccer hooligan.**\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the film makers - no longer under the watchful eye of the late Cubby Broccoli decided to run away from making James Bond movies. They also cast a short blonde man as 007.  They screwed with the gun barrel and the tone of the once lively, over the top and amusing series was now one of tedium.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's all over for Bond films now unless they decide to make real Bond films again and not this monotonous  and bland rubbish.\r\n\r\nIt's  shame that Cubby was not still around to keep Eon Productions in line and stop them ruining 40 years of hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Potential Kermode",
            "Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nCasino Royale is directed by Martin Campbell and adapted by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis from a story written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini. It's the 21st film in the James Bond franchise.\r\n\r\nPlot finds Craig as Bond, newly promoted to 00 status, he is thrust into the murky world of high financed terrorism.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest series of films to get right, with some of the most committed of fans, is that of the James Bond series. To wit, there will never ever be a Bond film that will appease every fan across the board. The complaints will range from not enough gadgets, too far removed from Fleming's essence, not serious enough and vice a versa: too darn serious. Then there is the usual round of arguments concerning the leading man stepping into the tuxedo, for every Bond fan ready to fight to the death in the name of Sean Connery, I'll find you another prepared to back Timothy Dalton's take on the Martini swigging legend. Once it became clear that Pierce Brosnan had run his course as Bond, bowing out with the super silly Die Another Day in 2002, the pressure for any new Bond, both the actor and the makers, was immense. 2006 and time had moved on, and we live in different cinema times, spy movies are a different breed to what went before, The Bourne Identity had raised the bar. The news filtered thru that Bond was to be rebooted and that Daniel Craig was the man to be Bond. The howls of derision could be heard from as far as the tropical locations so in keeping with a James Bond plot. Too Blonde, too craggy faced, not tall enough, and why reboot a much loved franchise anyway? It was war and the heat was turned up to full.\r\n\r\nCasino Royale still has its critics, but as majorities go as regards a Bond film, this one has the biggest sway. Sure, the Daniel Craig haters will not be bowed, they can't after all lose face after such a vitriolic campaign against his casting, but few, I suspect, can seriously deny Casino Royale is not a magnificent Bond movie. Just a peak at the Worldwide box office figures shows you how well received it was, making nearly $600 million, those are figures that do not lie. The truth is that Casino Royale has almost everything you could wish for from a Bond movie, and a little more. Gorgeous locations, beautiful women and reams of action; where, the stunt department reach new heights. It's also refreshingly in keeping with Fleming's original story, only major difference here is that the makers have upgraded it to a post 9/11 world. There's nods to traditional franchise staples, whilst also neatly streamlining some of the previous film's comedy scene fillers. Smart villain too, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre, complete with creepy eye issue and loyal girlfriend, is a villain not trying to blow up the world because he's mad, but trying to outwit Bond to stay alive! That's great stuff that keeps a Bond thriller alive and well.\r\n\r\nBut for all the energy and pyrotechnics (there's enough in this one film to have filled half a dozen of previous Bond entries), a Bond film can only succeed if the leading man is up to scratch. Thankfully, and joyously, Craig nails it, both in physicality, swagger and raw egotistical aggression. More telling is that Craig's Bond is more human that what we are used too, at one time suave and appearing unruffled, the next, bruised battered and emotionally conflicted. This is a new and rounded Bond, given impetus by Craig's powerful presence. He is helped by Eva Green putting brains and slinkiness into Vesper Lynd, a Bond girl to turn Bond's head in a way not seen since Diana Rigg's Tracy di Vicenzo in OHMSS. Though one of the film's rare missteps is to under write the part. Felix Leiter also gets a quality tune up in the form of Jeffrey Wright, Judi Dench's M kicks arse and Giancarlo Giannini adds a touch of continental class as Bond's Montenegro contact Ren\u00e9 Mathis. Layered over the top is a nifty score by David Arnold, blending traditional Bond flavours with high energy bursts and Phil Meheux's photography brings optical delights in the Bahamas, Czech Republic and Italy.\r\n\r\nOpening with the best chase sequence in the whole franchise and closing with an ultimate Bond moment, this is reboot supreme. It's high energy with intelligent humanistic smarts and Bond is back: blonder, brutal and most assuredly better. 9/10",
            "i liked Daniel Craig more as the right bond with action, charm, cunning all in one",
            "Great James Bond movie and perfect debut for Daniel Craig. He may, at least in the last couple outings, resent the role, he makes for a bruiser version of the character. Pierce Brosnan is still my favorite as his movies came out in the 90s (i.e. the years for watching Bond movies), but this was an all around great film, not to mention the lovely Eva Green coming on to the scene. **4.5/5**",
            "_**Daniel Craig debuts as Bond**_\r\n\r\nBased on Ian Fleming\u2019s novel, \u201cCasino Royale\u201d (2006) goes back to the beginning with James Bond (Daniel Craig) earning his 00 status with MI6. \u2018M\u2019 (Judi Dench) then sends Bond after a private banker who funds terrorists (Mads Mikkelsen), which leads to action in Madagascar, a poker game & romance in the Bahamas, thwarting the destruction of a prototype airliner in Miami, a high-stakes tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro and a thrilling finale in Venice. Caterina Murino and Eva Green also appear on the feminine front.\r\n\r\nCraig is more rough-hewn than Pierce Brosnan and more akin to Timothy Dalton, albeit without the smirk. Craig has the gravitas to pull-off the role and is utterly convincing.\r\n\r\nLet's face it, James Bond flicks aren\u2019t that deep. They may have convoluted plots, but there's little character depth and no heavy subtext commenting on the human condition. They're spy thrillers with an ultra-cool protagonist, beautiful women, spectacular locations, amazing gadgets, global political intrigue, gambling matches, wild action and megalomaniac villains. That's it. Yet they're very entertaining, which is why the series has been such a hit since 1962 when \"Dr. No\" was released.\r\n\r\nYet, with the exception of \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" (1969), there's very little character depth. Take James himself: Women to him are only meaningful as (1) a sexual dalliance or (2) a means to fulfill his mission. I mention this to point out how \"Casino Royale\" boldly changes this. The film has character depth and shows why Bond is the way he is. For instance, there are a couple amazing conversations between James and his potential woman in the story, Vesper (Eva Green), and they're full of insights. The dialog is snappy & intriguing and the performances are right-on.\r\n\r\nBy the way, someone complained that all the women in Bond flicks are loose and willing to sleep with any man at the drop of a hat. No, they're just willing to sleep with James Bond, lol. I'm not saying it's right, but it does reflect the alluring charisma of the suave Mr. Bond.\r\n\r\nThere are some thrilling action sequences, like the long, unrelenting chase at a construction site after the title credits, but there are also some quality dramatic segments. For instance, the main poker match at the titular casino is well-staged and suspenseful.\r\n\r\n\"Casino Royale\" strikes me as a mixture of the first half of \"Goldfinger\" with the serious tone of \"The Living Daylights\" & \"Licence to Kill.\u201d Don't expect the comic booky approach of \"You Only Live Twice,\" the cartoonish-ness of \u201cDiamonds are Forever\u201d or the science-fiction (and sometimes goofiness) of \"Moonraker.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 24 minutes, and was shot in the Czech Republic, Venice, Bahamas and England.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+",
            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/casino-royale-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Casino Royale is a near-perfect debut of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. This brutal version of the famous protagonist is beautifully interpreted by Craig, who contradicted the naysayers at the time of release and delivers a phenomenal performance as the iconic 007. His witty humor, irresistible charm, and excellent line deliveries find a close match in Eva Green's take of the \"Bond girl\", whose intelligence and strong attitude puts aside any generic, formulaic traits. Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as always as the vulnerable antagonist, but his impact on the overall picture is slightly underwhelming. The action set pieces are worthy of belonging to blockbusters of today, holding impressive stunt work and cinematography. Martin Campbell creates one of those films I can't pinpoint any flaws. Bond fans will feel delighted.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "From the breathtaking stunts in the opening chase to the suspenseful high-stakes poker game, \u2018Casino Royale\u2019 gets everything right, introducing Craig as a tougher, grittier and more realistic Bond. James Bond.\r\n\r\n10/10",
            "As reboots go, this is probably the best I've seen. Daniel Craig takes up the mantle of Ian Fleming's \"007\" in this two-part thriller that starts off at break neck speed and rarely drops below third gear for almost 2\u00bd hours. Having just attained his licence to kill status - after disposing of the double-crossing \"Dryden\" (Malcolm Sinclair), he is now hot on the trail of a courier in an African republic. After a chase of pretty epic proportions that sees them leaping from buildings and cranes before \"Bond\" finally manages to trash an embassy, he obtains a cellphone with just one word. What does it mean? Well now he must use all of his roughly hewn skills to find out - a challenge that takes him via the Bahamas to Miami where he has two thwart a daring attack at the airport on a brand new airliner, that would bankrupt the manufacturer and make someone $100m. That someone is now seriously annoyed - and in quite considerable danger themselves, so phase two of the story starts - and this is where it gets interesting. Off to the beautiful land of Montenegro for the ultimate game of poker. Staked by a rather wary HM Government, he is put in the capable hands of \"Vesper\" (Eva Green) and with the help of local fixer \"Mathis\" (Giancarlo Giannini) faces his new nemesis \"Le Schifre\" (Mads Mikkelsen). Quite literally - winner takes all. The story here is strong, the plot has twists - especially towards the end; there is loads of action, gadgets - a cracking Aston Martin; and loads of glamour. That latter element was largely missing during the Dalton/Brosnan eras for this suave and debonaire super-spy. Craig exudes a classiness about him, and Green likewise as she quickly realises that his is a dangerous business. Mikkelsen makes for a good baddie - so much of his acting is done through his expressions, and here he radiates a sort of measured menace that proves quite effective as the story reaches it's rather painful climax! David Arnold has written a score that nods to the John Barry sweeping and orchestral style of the early films and the writing doesn't waste time trying with the puerile double-entendres that dogged some of the earlier outings for \"Bond\". The one man missing, rather notably, is \"Q\" and \"Moneypenny\" has become a bloke called \"Villiers\" (Tobias Menzies) working for Dame Judi Dench's no-nonsense \"M\". The denouement is as action packed as the rest of it, and it introduces us to the idea that there is an organisation out there guiding so much of the criminal fraternity. A spectre of things to come, perhaps? Let's hope this is a sign of a new and improved vivacity for this tiring franchise. This is a very good re-start.",
            "It honestly wasn't bad and I really hate Daniel Craig as James Bond, he seems to be the only person on earth that does NOT want to be James Bond. And it kind of sucks watching someone play Bond that doesn't look like he wants to be there.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the fact that they rebooted the franchise, and I am not a fan of that either.\r\n\r\nAnd, well, the film had 3 endings didn't it? I mean, literally there were two natural endings but they milked it for a third one. So by the time you get around to ending three you're screaming \"enough already!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it started strong. I mean, it started REALLY strong even for a reboot. And it made the clever move of keeping the same M, and that helped stop the people like me that hate reboots from grumbling too much.\r\n\r\nIt did away with Q and the over-the-top gadgets and, yeah, Python Q wasn't good plus every Bond has his own feel.\r\n\r\nSo what was left was a solid action movie with mostly great acting (especially from the Villains) that was great... up until it SHOULD have ended the first time.",
            "Depressingly predictably Hollywood.\r\nThis is hardly a 007 movie, and can't be called a \"film\". It's just the same Hollywood formula of contriving a story to be as depressing as possible.\r\nThe same formula Hollywood had prided itself on since about 1965.\r\nIt's very dull, and there's no imagery.\r\n007 films once had exotic scenery that was done in a cinematic way.\r\nNo more. \r\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with Daniel Craig. It doesn't matter who plays 007 when the writer and director are control freaks for hatefulness.\r\nIf you can stay awake through the dull scenery and ridiculous lines (Bond even says it doesn't matter what cards you have in a poker game. This movie goes beyond \"retarded\"), then you wonder what the plot is. Bond goes through a kidnapping ordeal and losing in cards, and he's obviously a victim of card cheating, but this genius doesn't suspect that.\r\nThen, we get the predictable ending that is so Hollywood. \r\nThis movie would be the worst Bond movie ever if not for \"A View to a Kill\".",
            "This generally considered the best Bond film and for me it's top 3."

That said, there is still fun to be had here, and it may work better at home than a cinematic experience.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-gentlemen-underwhelming-but-fun-return-to-form-for-guy-ritchie",
            "**_Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining_**\r\n\r\n>_You don't crucify people! Not on Good Friday!_\r\n\r\n- Harold Shand; _The Long Good Friday_ (1980)\r\n\r\nThe Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_ (1998) and _snatch._ (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing _RocknRolla_ (2008), _The Gentlemen_ comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema such as _Sherlock Holmes_ (2009), _Sherlo__ck Holmes: A Game of Shadows_ (2011), _The Man from U.N.C.L.E_. (2015), _King Arthur: Legend of the Sword_ (2017), and _Aladdin_ (2019). Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy man-whore into S&M, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here \u2013 if you've seen _Lock, Stock_ or _snatch._, you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect \u2013 but _The Gentlemen_ is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. _The Gentlemen_ definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.\r\n\r\nThe film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around \u00a3400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsen) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him \u2013 Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled _Bush_) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable \"_cockney Cleopatra_\" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, _The Gentlemen_ is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices \u2013 a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's _The Man From U.N.C.L.E._. All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously\r\nself-reflexive the film becomes \u2013 Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator, and a discussion of the importance of sound leads to his dismissal of Francis Ford Coppola's _The Conversation_ (1974) as \"_a bit boring._\"\r\n\r\nIn terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before \u2013 the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes \u2013 the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Emily Bront\u00eb's _Wuthering Heights_ (1847) springs to mind) and film (Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell's _Performance_ (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background \u2013 gentrification is ever present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"_just hates them junkies_,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.\r\n\r\nOne of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new \u2013 traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc, or Coach debating with one of his boxers whether it's racist to call someone \"_a black c**t_\", even though they are black and they are a c**t. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and _milieu_ \u2013 there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed _The Gentlemen_. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've always been a fan of Guy Ritchie's style. While I do admit that he tends to overuse his own techniques (like he does in this movie), he always manages to bring something unique to his projects. He delivered a pretty good live-action remake of Aladdin while offering his own take (Jasmine has more compelling motivations). I surprisingly enjoyed King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword, but the ending is disappointing. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Sherlock Holmes films are entertaining and fun, to say the least. So, yes, I was sort of excited to watch The Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nWith such a stellar cast, how can someone not be interested in an old-fashioned crime-thriller? First of all, I want to get this out right away: it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, sure, but for people who know how films usually work, Ritchie applies a storytelling method that's going to make every \"filmmaking nerd\" lose their minds. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) is mostly the narrator of the entire story, and he's basically interpreting a \"version\" of Guy Ritchie telling the story of his own \"flick\".\r\n\r\nThis means Fletcher goes on and on about film specs like aspect ratios and film gauges but also helping the audience understand what's happening, by announcing if the story is near its climax or if \"the plot thickens\". It's a captivating and funny way of using exposition without it being lazy or forced. Grant also makes sure to ask the questions the audience should be asking. This way, even people who don't like to think when they go to the cinema (yes, they exist) will be able to follow the mystery unraveling.\r\n\r\nObviously, the unbelievable cast makes this movie so much fun. Matthew McConaughey is a masterful actor when it comes to carrying long dialogues. Everything he says is always engaging, either by the way he says it, his expressions, or the physical intensity he puts into his own words. Charlie Hunnam (Ray) probably delivers his most amusing performance to date. Ray is definitely going to be a fan-favorite character, and his interactions with Fletcher (with who he spends most of the runtime) are hilarious.\r\n\r\nHenry Golding (Dry Eye), Michelle Dockery (Rosalind Pearson), and Jeremy Strong (Matthew) all give excellent performances, but Colin Farrell is the best of this group of characters as Coach. His scenes are some of the funniest sequences of the entire year so far. From his accent to the action he eventually gets into, he's one of those characters who will leave everyone wanting more. As for the story, it's undoubtedly one of the most complex screenplays I've seen in a while. Comparing with Knives Out, the narrative structure ends up being a bit similar.\r\n\r\nBoth possess tons of twists and turns that will make everyone scratch their heads for quite some time. Both show different events of the story, featuring a specific character at a particular time in a distinct manner (flashback, flashforward, simple exposition). However, The Gentlemen abuses from its own trick a bit too much, especially during the first half. Something entertaining can quickly turn into something pretty annoying if the storytelling isn't well-balanced. Can't have too much of anything, right?\r\n\r\nThis is my overall issue with the film. Guy Ritchie brings something cool and fresh to escape heavy exposition, but it's still a lot of information to transmit, and it doesn't always work smoothly. Some subplots didn't need to go so deep, which takes time away from more emotionally investing storylines. Nevertheless, in the end, Ritchie stitches every story together seamlessly to create a very well-written flick. With so many intricate layers, it's extremely difficult to bring it all together to make a cohesive finale, but Ritchie does it superbly.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Gentlemen is another hit for Guy Ritchie, and it might even be his best movie yet. With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

            "Great story, great cast and performances, great direction, FX, photography, care for the details, OST and editing.\r\n\r\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n is a real titan and Sandra Bullock goes for the Oscar.\r\n\r\nIt is not a 10 because at some point the chain of events goes further that it should.",
            "There is no doubt that this is a very pleasing movie from a purely visual point of view. This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing, talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen. Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space? I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere. In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable.\n\nOverlooking these, unfortunately all too often occurring issues, the movie is fairly okay as a whole. Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all-star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it. Technically it was very good with nice special effects. Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given. Clooney felt a bit out-of-place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much.\n\nTo me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie.",
            "**A cinematography masterclass!**\r\n\r\nThe cinematography of this movie is a breathtaking feat, unlike anything I have ever seen! The commitment to realism influenced every decision throwing the audience into the intensity of every moment. An enthralling ride from beginning to end with overwhelming effects and masterful storytelling that makes you feel every second. This movie absolutely earned its place on the list of \u201c1001 Movies to See Before You Die.\u201d",
            "Gravity is an epic thrill ride that starts and never ends. I have not felt continued tension like this film in some time. The entire movie is so isolated and desperate, it is incredibly immersive. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The script is a bit rough at times, a large portion of the dialogue does not seem realistic and can come off as corny sometimes, especially with George Clooney's character. Overall, it is short, face paced, and thrilling and I would highly recommend.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great",
            "Sandra Bullock's acting prowess is truly remarkable. Whether she's in a hit or a miss, her performances are always worth watching multiple times. Even in her less successful films, she brings something special to the screen that keeps you captivated.\r\n\r\nThis particular movie was a rollercoaster of excitement, struggles, and emotions. It had me on the edge of my seat, eagerly anticipating what would happen next. The thrill of the storyline held my attention throughout, leaving me both craving more and feeling a sense of fear about what might unfold. It was undeniably intense and kept me hooked from start to finish.",
            "Simply terrible. I'm not a fan of the whole tens of improbable bad events happening in sequence genre, but this is just taking it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist just presses random buttons and is so incompetent you wonder how she even became an astronaut. The physics and orbital mechanics in this movie make absolutely zero sense. One example out of the hundreds: it's highly improbable that the ISS and Tiangong would be within viewing distance of one another. And if they were they wouldn't stay that way for the roughly 2 hours the movie lasts, since they had very different inclinations. It would be impossible to reach one from the other with a single thrust designed for landing, even more impossible with manual controls. The first couple attempted rendezvous in history were from distances of 5 km (not the 100 in the movie) and failed, even though the pilots were clearly more competent than the protagonist here. There are so many errors here, I wouldn't be surprised if the Earth was flat (at least it would make the movie funny). This isn't just nitpicking since the movie tries to be realistic, but fails miserably.\r\n\r\nSure, the CGI is nice, but that's hardly a selling point in this day and age (or when the movie launched)"

            "Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie, it was one of my all time favourites. Unlike Quantum of Solace, I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.\r\n\r\nSomething I found interesting is the idea about Bond getting old and how the job of an MI6 agent is not something you can do forever. It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.\r\n\r\nIt's true that the last 1/3 of Skyfall didn't feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that's why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a different look at James Bond and Skyfall was no exception.\r\n\r\nLike I said, great movie. Execution on all accounts were solid like you'd expect. I hope Mendes gets a chance to do the next film.",
            "Skyfall is a great movie. In my opinion the best proformas by Daniel Craig I have see in all his Bond movies. The title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. The story line is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Silva, played by Javier Bardem was excellent and he played him very well. All in all a very good movie.",
            "Bond (Daniel Craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world, this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the British agents who work for MI6. On the mission, Mr. Bond is shot by one of his own (an agent named Eve, played by Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. However, Bond is not dead, and when he resurfaces, he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called Silva (Javier Bardem), an old favorite of M (Judi Dench).\r\n\r\nWhile Bond is out in the world, M discovers that someone, presumably Silva, has hacked their computers and threats to expose the true names of the British agents. However, it is also clear that the enemy has other plans, plans of terrorism. Bond is now in a race against time before more agents are revealed, or worse yet, before M is killed by their mysterious enemy. Fortunately, everything works out perfectly for 007, who finds the mysterious Silva with little effort.\r\n\r\nOK, admittedly, this was a very short summary of the plot in Skyfall, but in all honesty, there isn't a big plot in this movie. I could have given some spoilers about the ending, and maybe added a bit about Mallory (Ralph fiennes), but really, this is an extremely simple plot. Not at all worthy of a big iconic character like James Bond.\r\n\r\nIt is classic 007, with everything thats part of such an adventure, like product placement (not a favorite of mine, in fact I get rather annoyed when its as obvious as the watch in the opening of the movie), car chases (in this case, more like a motorcycle chase across the roofs of some unknown city), beautiful women (which are exactly as shallow and pointless as you would expect), and lastly a total lack of emotions and realism.\r\n\r\nI am not a big Bond fan, and haven't seen all of the movies in the series, so I am probably not the right person to review this movie. I do not understand what it is that draws people into the cinema time after time, to watch yet another Bond movie\u2026 when they can watch something original with a real plot and real characters. Perhaps these people like the shallow characters, who care little for the safety of the innocent people in the world, yes, I said it. Look carefully in the opening sequence, how the female agent cares little for the people on the bridge, as she shoots after the enemy. Later in that scene, she finds it really hard to shoot the enemy, because what if she hit Bond instead. I may be wrong in this assumption, but isn't MI6 here to protect the innocent people? Perhaps these people like the almost infinite number of one-liners that made my ears bleed at one point. Why are we treated this way? Do the people who makes these movies really think we are so stupid?\r\n\r\nBefore I actually say something nice about Skyfall, because I can do that, I just want to give a small piece of advice to future Bond villains, because who are we kidding, there will be more Bond movies in the future\u2026 my advice is this: Always remember to close the door behind you, whether its an actual door, or maybe a manhole (cover). If you don't do this, Bond will surely find you. But of course, perhaps you are dying to have him on your tail, in which case, you are doing it exactly right!\r\n\r\nOK, something positive. Skyfall is a beautiful movie, in a very obvious (and superficial) way. The colors are just stunning, especially when we follow Bond swimming through the night of Shanghai, high above the streets. There is no denying the imagery and action of the movie, in every possible way, this is some of the best the world has to offer. I'd also like to give a shout out to Albert Finney, whose character (Kincade) raises the quality of the movie, and actually give it some human emotion.\r\n\r\nThe very last thing I want to say is this\u2026 why hire Sam Mendes for this movie? Why hire him when he is not allowed to use the powers that God have given him? Where are the human emotions, where are the dark humor, where are the personal stories that capture our hearts as much as our minds? If you want to watch a real Sam Mendes movie, I suggest the following American Beauty, Jarhead and even, Revolutionary Road.\r\n\r\n_Last words... only watch this movie if you have nothing to do\u2026 at all\u2026 and if you are a hardcore fan of 007 and feel forced to watch every movie in the franchise. This movie reminds me why I only rarely watch big Hollywood blockbusters._",
            "How safe do you feel?\r\n\r\nBond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. \r\n\r\nThere is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results. \r\n\r\nSkyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart. \r\n\r\nThe plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves. \r\n\r\nA washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo. \r\n\r\nBut ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old. \r\n\r\nAll the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins. \r\n\r\nIt's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10",
            "Me and my oldest son have been doing a bit of pseudo binge watching of James Bond. Every weekend we have been watching two of the movies starting with Dr. No quite a few weekends ago. Last weekend we arrived at the Daniel Craig ones. I had actually not watched those ones before. I have to, grudgingly (I am a Sean Connery fan), admit that the first two we watched were not at all bad.\r\n\r\nHowever, today we watched Skyfall. What the f\u2026? This is not a James Bond movie! If it had been just some other movie I would probably have thought it would not be a too bad one. However, it pretends to be a James Bond movie and as such it is utter crap. It is a bloody Hollywood drama written by someone with a total lack of respect for the Franchise, not to mention the old Bond fans.\r\n\r\nJames Bond should be out hunting international villains. Villains with a good chunk of bad guy charisma I might add. What we got however was some loathsome prick having a grudge because M didn\u2019t come to his rescue when he fucked up.\r\n\r\nThe British Secret service should also be just that, a powerful organisation protecting Britain (and the rest of the civilized world) from communists, terrorists, criminal superorganisations like Spectre or whatever.  Having scenes with M more or less on trial and having to defend herself in front of a bunch of clueless political asshats is just crap and it is definitely not the kind of crap that should be in a James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nThe whole movie is just full of sensationalist shit, politically correct crap, killing of popular characters, sentimental bullshit and other nonsens of the kind you would expect in a bloody Hollywood soap opera. And what about the new Q? A boring brat with a over-inflated ego. Not fun at all.\r\n\r\nEven the special effects are debatable. For example, if you make a subway train crash by blowing a hole in it\u2019s path then for Christ sake put some crash test dummies or something in it to at least make some pretense of it not being an empty mock-up!\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the worst Bond movie ever. My disappointment with this movie cannot be overstated.",
            "Great theme song and a much more balanced movie compared to Quantum of Solace, and the story is well written, revealing Bond's background and the motherly relationship with M (contrast with a more antagonistic portrayal in the Brosnan series). Javier Bardem as the villain was fantastic, almost Joker like in his planning. The only setback is the finale, sure some nice action and explosions but not quite as thrilling versus Casino Royale. Still, one of the better in the Bond series overall. **4.0/5**",
            "_**Can you go home again?**_\r\n\r\nAfter 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead-in-action in Turkey, the computer of \u2018M\u2019 (Judi Dench) is hacked and there\u2019s an attack on the MI6 headquarters in London. M & Bond suspect it\u2019s an inside job, which leads James to Shanghai, Macao and a mysterious island off the coast of China, then back to London. Bond has to find sanctuary for M, but you know what they say about going home again? Javier Bardem plays a heavy and Ralph Fiennes an MI6 official.\r\n\r\n\u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) thankfully includes the character depth of \u201cCasino Royale\u201d (2006) and fixes the confusing 4 clips-per-second action of \u201cQuantum of Solace\u201d (2008). Don\u2019t get me wrong, \u201cQuantum\u201d can be appreciated as the action-oriented second half of \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d but it\u2019s easily one of the lesser installments in the franchise. \u201cSkyfall,\u201d by contrast, stands with the best.\r\n\r\nThe movie saves the best for last, but I don\u2019t want to give anything away. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a refreshing change for the series, the locations are fabulous and a classic actor unexpectedly shows up.  \r\n\r\nBesides Dench on the feminine front, there\u2019s B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe as Severine in China and Naomie Harris as MI6 agent Eve. Tonia Sotiropoulou also has a brief scene in Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes, and was shot in Turkey, England, China and Scotland.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",
            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/skyfall-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Skyfall is not only the entry that this James Bond saga needed, but it's my favorite movie of the Daniel Craig Era. From the exceptionally intriguing narrative filled with shocking developments to Javier Bardem's terrifying portrayal of a fascinating antagonist, Sam Mendes offers his remarkable directing skills to create a film worthy of much praise.\r\n\r\nThe GOAT of cinematography, Roger Deakins, makes every inch of the screen drip cinematic beauty with eyegasmic wide shots and mind-blowing lighting, making this the best-looking Bond flick ever. Technically, it's challenging to find elements less than simply perfect.\r\n\r\nPhenomenal acting all-around elevates an extraordinarily impactful character work, culminating in an emotionally powerful third act. A slightly overextended runtime doesn't stop me from considering this a flawless Bond movie.\r\n\r\nI can't endorse it more than this.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",
            "Ok, first things first. \"Skyfall\" and \"crumble\" do not rhyme. Sorry Adele, but they don't! Luckily, the rest of this story is almost as good as \"Casino Royale\" (2006). Daniel Craig reprises his role as \"007\", this time charged with thwarting a dastardly plan by the enigmatic \"Silva\" to avenge himself on none other than \"M\" (Dame Judi Dench) herself. He has managed to successfully infiltrate just about every system MI6 has and obtain a list of agents the world over. When he starts publishing these names, and the body count starts to rise, it falls to \"Bond\" to engage with his clever and malevolent foe. Bardem is effective as the baddie here. He has a certain, almost menacing, effeteness as he quite literally toys with his quarry. Loads of gadgets, explosions, a welcome appearance from the original Aston Martin and an action-packed pace keep this moving along well. The ending is a bit far-fetched, even by \"James Bond\" standards, and that even though it did give us chance to enjoy a suitably eclectic contribution from Albert Finney, was all just bit daft. The supporting efforts don't bode so well, either. Ralph Fiennes seems set for a larger role in future films and he doesn't really add much and though she does well enough, the role offered to Naomie Harris' \"Eve\" is just too insubstantial for her to assert herself on much of the story. That said, though, it's very much at the top end of the Craig outings for this character and it does look good on big screen,",
            "**Skyfall understands, admires, and elevates Bond to excellence and mastery to an unexpected level and unmatched by its predecessors.**\r\n\r\nSkyfall is The Dark Knight of Daniel Craig\u2019s James Bond films. Sam Mendes took all Casino Royale had built and elevated it to heights never before reached by Bond. Everything fires perfectly on all cylinders. The story is rich and delves further into the character of a bond than ever before. The action set pieces, the locales, and the cinematography are all masterpieces that establish Skyfall as an excellent James Bond film but take it further, placing it among the best movies of all time. Judi Dench\u2019s performance as M cements her legacy as a Bond great. And the excellent supporting cast grows with the brilliant casting and performances of Naomi Harris as Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, and Ben Whishaw as Q. Still, the biggest standout is Javier Bardem as the villainous Silva - one of the greatest Bond antagonists of all time. His unpredictable and menacing nature is cloaked in a slightly goofy demeanor and skewed moral code. Skyfall asks and answers questions unlike any Bond before while staying true to what makes James Bond so compelling and entertaining. Just like The Dark Knight for Batman, even people who are not traditional Bond fans will be impressed with Skyfall.",
            "By the time Skyfall dropped my hatred of Craig Era Bond was pretty solidified. I started to realize that this was going to be the Bond that hated being Bond. That Bond was going to go down a dark hole that I was really going to loath.\r\n\r\nBut... Javier Bardem really nailed it didn't he?\r\n\r\nJavier Bardem nailed it. Judi Dench had her best showing as M... ever, in fact it was so good that it kind of made you made she was relegated to a side character in all the other Bond movies.\r\n\r\nAnd the story was great... it was so great that Disneyer ripped off huge chunks of it when they made Black Panther.\r\n\r\nBy 2012 you got the feeling that Sony was going to take the 007 down a dark and evil rabbit hole that would destroy the Franchise, but Skyfall still ranks as one of the best Bond movies in franchise history.",
            "Keeping the Bond series down.\r\nPoor Daniel Craig isn't at fault for these totally uninspired, unmotivated stories he appears in.\r\nMaybe his agent is at fault. But while Craig makes money, his memory will be forgotten in a hundred years, if these 007 fiascos are his high points. \r\nThey probably won't be his high points. Good for him.\r\nHere, we get more of the modern day movie making which eliminates all the exotic scenery and all the wit and all the inspiration and all the motivation.\r\nInstead, we get another demigod villain on the order of horror movies. He may as well be Freddy, Jason, or Wishmaster. That's how he's written.\r\nSo, we have the worst Bond villain in movie history. Certainly, he's the most Hollywood.\r\nWhich makes this as dull as watching a pot boil.\r\nEven the high octane action sequences can't save this flop.",

            "I wish so badly I could separate the art from the artist, and this is the only reason I cannot give \u2018Marriage Story\u2019 the five stars it actually deserves. My own issues with Baumbach aside, however, and it\u2019s shocking to me that a film so simple can be so nearly flawless (I mean this technically too; the film is shot, edited, paced and scored beautifully). Despite how much I cried, it finds beauty and comedy in the tiniest of moments. It\u2019s an ugly portrait of two flawed people and therefore never easy to watch, but it is one of the most rewarding experiences I have had with a film in years. I just hope I never have to experience it myself.\r\n- Ashley Teresa\r\n\r\nRead Ashley's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-marriage-story-simply-extraordinary",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI don't even know how to start this review\u2026 Marriage Story is one of those movies that stays with me long after I've finished it. I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas I've ever seen. That's due to the award-worthy performances of Adam Driver (Charlie Barber) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole Barber), but also because of Noah Baumbach's incredibly layered screenplay. In addition to this, Baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year. With the help of his DP, Robbie Ryan, he sets the platform for Driver and Johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are.\r\n\r\nSome people watch films to forget their daily issues. Some just want to have fun. Some want to learn more about a particular true story. However, there's not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater (or, in this case, their couch) entertained. Marriage Story has such an emotionally complicated premise that it's tough to convince people to sit and watch. I mean, who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours? Who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves? Yelling, fighting, court, custody, lawyers\u2026 It's not exactly an attention-grabber.\r\n\r\nI imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst. I'm writing this because I've seen some negativity towards people who simply don't want to watch Baumbach's depiction of a depressing event. It's perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one, especially if it hits too close to home. In my case, I've never gone through a divorce (hopefully, I'll never will), and usually I can \"enjoy\" this type of sad, frustrating, bittersweet films (Manchester by the Sea, A Ghost Story) for what they are, no matter how tragic.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose one-word praise: realistic. There's no way around it. The palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well. Only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind can't understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate, and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they don't exactly mean. The exaggeration and over-the-top arguments are part of every couple's life. They can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress, work, accumulation of little things, or simply because it's just not a good day.\r\n\r\nMarriage Story doesn\u2019t deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because that\u2019s not what divorces are. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love(d) for years without end, even more when there\u2019s a kid involved in the process. Baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness, but that\u2019s not something that happens during a situation like this. It\u2019s a heart-wrenching phase to live through, and I believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so.\r\n\r\nTHE scene with Driver and Johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticism-wise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium. The raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive. Their chemistry is so inexplicably real. I never, not even for a single second, thought that I was watching fictional characters. Nicole and Charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family. Baumbach's use of long takes really elevate every single sequence, allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act.\r\n\r\nTechnically, there's no better acting this year than what Driver and Johansson deliver. Both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines. Making dinner, drinking tea, going to the bathroom, chopping a carrot, blowing their nose, standing up, sitting down, walking around the room, crying, smiling, laughing\u2026 All of this in a single take! Several times!! Scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart, but Adam proves why he's the frontrunner at the 2019's Oscars. His restraint when Charlie is trying to be polite even though he's mad, or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go (excellent build-up), are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year.\r\n\r\nNot trying to diminish Johansson's display. Both deliver career-best performances, in my opinion. Both deserve every award that exists. The supporting cast is also impeccable, and I know that Laura Dern (Nora Fanshaw) is probably going to be nominated. Still, the two leads are so engaging and captivating that I couldn't be impressed with anyone else. The only person to rise to the main actors' level is Noah Baumbach himself. With the best screenplay of 2019, he offers the audience an incredibly complex story, filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue.\r\n\r\nHe controls the movie's pacing beautifully, and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark, depressing mood. My only issue with the film has to do with its replay value. We all have been through this situation: watching a fantastic movie, only once, and never again. Marriage Story is going to be one of those films for me. I love everything about it, but I know the chances of a rewatch are very, very small. It's a profoundly unsettling story, super uncomfortable at times, and I really don't want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Noah Baumbach delivers what I believe to be its career-best flick, Marriage Story. With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019. Don't miss it, and try not to cry.\r\n\r\nRating: A",
            "This movie is a thoroughly humane and sensitive portrayal of the painful process that is \"divorce\". Noah Baumbach, who himself had a divorce with actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, seems to have drawn from his own life experiences for this film. The characters are all balanced and multilayered; the acting of the leads, specially Johansson and Driver, lend a particular personality to their characters. Everyone plays their role to the perfection, even the supporting cast including Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and the criminally underused Merritt Wever. This movie shows how a process as messy as divorce turns two people who love and respect each other into one wishing death on the other. No, they are not bad people , they are just people under \"bad\" circumstances, and Marriage story drives that point home. Overall: a brilliant movie, and a great way to end the year.",
            "I don't have a kid. I've never been divorced. Or even married. Though I guess I was once a kid myself, I'm not the product of a divorced couple. I'm not even the product of a married one. Everyone I know who has gotten married or had kids did it before I met them, or stopped hanging out with me almost immediately afterward. Everyone I've ever met who got divorced either did it before I met them, or is someone I stopped hanging out with beforehand. So I don't come to the subject of _Marriage Story_ with a wealth of experience, which means it doesn't exactly scream \"relatable content\" to me.\r\n\r\nLet me start where it's easiest and everyone seems to agree: The performances. Everyone in _Marriage Story_ is pretty great, none of the characterisations changed my life, but I get it. As a chance to display what these actors are capable of in a mundane setting where all that matters is their performance, yes, absolutely, _Marriage Story_ has buckets of success.\r\n\r\nOutside of this though... I'm not even going to say that it \"fails\" elsewhere, just that it didn't win me. I like bleak movies, I like movies that make me feel something, even if it's sad. But _Marriage Story_ isn't really that. It poses you the question of whether both Charlie and Nicole are good or bad people, and shows you each from their own and other's perspective. The ending seems to imply that they're good, or at the very least both good and bad (and aren't we all?) but that really doesn't matter very much when we just spent all this time watching both of them be horrible. I know that's life, that's real, that's people, and blah bl-blah bl-blah, but that's little consolation when I've just spent two-plus hours of my life being not at all compelled by a bunch of people being awful. Being awful convincingly, to the actors' respective credits, but in this setting that is not my idea of a good time at the movies.\r\n\r\n46%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",
            "\u201cI never really came alive for myself; I was only feeding his aliveness.\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve said some harsh things about Netflix movies in the past, but recently I\u2019m starting to warm up to them.\r\n\r\n\u2018Marriage Story\u2019 was absolutely excellent. A devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. It\u2019s incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. I guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. Lets just say my cheeks wasn\u2019t dry afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I wept.\r\n\r\nAdam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both gave masterclass performances. And I do mean some power house acting. Driver plays Charlie, a competitive and undaunted theater director that he is very clear about what he wants. Johansson plays Nicole, a mother who\u2019s a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. This is the best I\u2019ve seen from Johnasson. Her character delivers a monologue where she\u2019s explains the issues in her life that\u2019s all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast were all fantastic. Lauren Dern, Ray Liotta, Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty, and Alan Alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from Driver and Johansson. Even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.\r\n\r\nNot only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. Every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I was so glued to the movie from start to finish. One of the best screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nThis is the first Noah Baumbach movie I\u2019ve seen from him and I am aware of his other work, just haven\u2019t got around to watching them. However, I feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. We don\u2019t see the full relationship, but we do get to hear Nicole and Charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there\u2019s a montage that flash\u2019s through their routine life together with their son. Nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.\r\n\r\nThe score from Randy Newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. I loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. When the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they\u2019re enemies. They still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. It\u2019s also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Any other relationship movie ain't sh*t compared to this.",
            "Very well acted and bittersweet for sure, this is a movie that didn't really touch me deeply, mainly because didn't grow up in a split family or ever been married or have kids, so this I'm sure speaks to those with those kind of experiences. Still, can appreciate the performances from both Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver, proving once more how great actors they are and more than their respective blockbuster franchises. **4.0/5**"

Forced to improvise rescue and wait for\r\nhelp, the tense and violent situation quickly becomes a living nightmare\r\nas they fight to survive.\r\n\r\nThe tension level of the film is great as the early segments in the plane\r\ndid a great job of showing the routine of a pilot and also ramped up the\r\ntension. I can be a nervous passenger when a plane gets into bad weather\r\nand I found my palms getting sweaty and anxiety creeping in during the\r\ndetailed sequences of the flight in peril.\r\n\r\nThe action of the film was engaging as were the characters as they were\r\neasy to pull for despite not having much in the way of backstory or\r\ncharacter development.  The film has plenty of action as was engaging from\r\nstart to finish which makes \u201cPlane\u201d a pleasant diversion and one fan of\r\nButler will not want to miss.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",
            "I was pleasantly surprised by Plane. Going into it, I had pretty low expectations as it seemed to be a cheap, action flick that was built for the dad's in our life. But there were some pretty good performances, set pieces, and brutal action that raised this movie from mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe plot is incredibly bare bones: a plane gets damaged in a storm and crash lands on a desolate island. We've seen this used in countless films and TV shows throughout the years but, the way this is handled is pretty incredible. We see it from the pilots perspective as he and the stewards are trying to navigate the situation to create the best course of action to survive. It was done in a very believable way, giving us a glimpse at crash landing procedure and how truly indestructible planes are. The entire 30-minutes sequence had me on the edge of my seat even though I knew it was coming from a mile away. The CGI in this section was quite rough though as the plane looked like something rendered in an Xbox 360 game.\r\n\r\nThe movie does fall into some pretty classic tropes in movies like this. One being that almost all the \"good\" people are the classic white American men and woman, but the \"bad\" people (the island combatants and our main prisoner hero) are individuals of color. It is subtle, but something I noticed that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Also the depiction of how the Philippines refused to assist in their own territory was laughable. But it opened the way for the good men of the American military were there to save the day and kill some island terrorists. It has some minor military propaganda that didn't totally take away from my experience, but worth a mention. \r\n\r\nThe performances were all pretty good. Gerard Butler played his usual role, I enjoyed his charisma as a pilot but also the gruff and militaristic persona he pulled out from his previous service. Mike Colter was great as the ultimate badass of the movie, killing terrorists with whatever he could get his hands on. This was nothing against his performance, but I hated how they wrote his characters ending in the film. It did not do his character arch any justice and felt out of place. The rest of the cast was decent.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie delivers exactly what it promised in a short concise runtime and I cannot ask any more than that.\r\n\r\nScore: 63%\r\nVerdict: Decent",
            "May contain an odd spoiler \r\n\r\n\u201cPlane\u201d has a Scottish Pilot, Brodie Torrance ( Gerard Butler ) intent on getting his passengers to their destination in time to meet up with his daughter during the New Year festivities. However all does not go to plan when bad weather puts paid to any such activities and prematurely forces Brodie to make an emergency landing. During the attempt to land an FBI agent escorting a dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare ( Mike Colter ), drops his mobile phone. Rather than leave it during a dangerous decent he tries to retrieve it only to loose both his life and that of a stewardess trying to help him.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSurviving this landing on a remote island was not easy but the skills of Brodie saves the remaining passengers and crew. However far from praised for his actions the passengers decide it\u2019s rather an inconvenience and complain constantly as the crew try to repair the communications. Unfortunately there is much more for the passengers to complain about once they are taken hostage by rebel forces who control the Island. More deaths ensue, however Brodie and his new friend, Louis are the only two to avoid capture after killing a few rebels along the way. Brodie and Louis work together to dispatch more rebels in an attempt to rescue the hostages.\r\n\r\nWhat ensues is a Die Hard style action thriller but based at New Year rather than Christmas. \u201cPlane\u201d does have some tense moments but very much ticks every Die Hard trope box it can. What is extremely notable, much like Die Hard, a rather large number of rebels are killed compared to hostages. In hindsight, as requested by Brodie, if I was Hans Gruber , sorry the rebel leader, I\u2019d have let all the hostages go. I did enjoy this movie but for what it is, an action packed, nothing new , 1 hour 47 mins.\r\n\r\nNew tag line . Survive Together or Die Hard alone.",
            "OK, where is Jason Statham? He does these things so much better! Maybe he was off having an haircut so they decided to cast a distinctly wooden Gerard Butler as airline captain \"Torrance\" who is charged with flying his plane from Singapore to Tokyo before he heads on to his daughter's wedding in the USA. There aren't many passengers on his airliner, so to save cash and fuel he is directed to fly very near a violent storm that - well, next thing he has managed to land his sizeable aeroplane on a remote and lawless Filipino island (that luckily is replete with a dirt-track \"mining\" road that would not look out of place encircling Los Angeles). Now we happen to know that one of his few charges was also under the charge of the police, and now \"Brodie\" and the erstwhile captive - and useful - \"Gaspare\" (Mike Colter) must unite to fend off the venal bandits lead by their chief \"Junmar\" (Evan Dane Taylor) whilst getting a message to the rescue parties that can hopefully come and save their bacon. This film is so far-fetched that you might as well leave any need for reality at the door as you go in. The dialogue is pedestrian and the plot lurches from one implausibly half-baked scenario to another with consummate ease. That said, it hots up nicely for the last twenty minutes of gunfighting and that does rescue it a little from the mediocrity it probably deserves. It passed an hour and an half in the cinema easily enough, but it is not a film you will ever remember watching.",
            "**Plane is a well-done action thriller with a solid lead and good fight sequences. Nothing more. Nothing less.**\r\n\r\nPlane is a low-budget action/survival movie that checks all the boxes and provides plenty of gritty Gun fights and brutal melee combat along the way. The film that didn\u2019t spend much time picking a clever name also didn\u2019t waste much time on character development. Instead, the plot is centered on Gerard Butler as he works to secure the safety and survival of a small group of passengers. Unfortunately, the island they crash-landed on is full of a bunch of pirate/terrorist types, so Butler does some shooting and punching, and choking to save the day. Plane won\u2019t win any awards, but it is a solid action movie that I would watch again and recommend renting (probably not a whole $20 purchase to own, though) to any action fan. I\u2019m glad it got a theatrical release so people can trust that it\u2019s a little bigger budget and higher quality than most straight-to-stream action films.",

Originality, creativity, and deep exploration of themes or character arcs aren\u2019t exactly part of the screenplay, but Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet executes all his ideas in such an efficient manner that it fully justifies releasing in theaters instead of going straight to VOD.

When you watch the movie, you feel that it is a film in the early 2000s, and this makes you feel that you need to watch this type of movies from time to time. The movie managed to grab my attention because there is a factor of isolation. Isolation in the air while boarding the plane and the problems that occurred during take-off and after landing on the ground, which is the isolation of staying on the island.\r\n\r\nImagine you land the plane in an area controlled by separatists and the killers are people who don't follow the law. This movie has become a kind of survival, which is the struggle for survival, and these movies have a large type of viewers, regardless of the usual plot and the familiar and expected ending.\r\n\r\nIf i am from the kind of audience whose movies only depend on the plot, I will criticize the movie from beginning to end, but there are sometimes movies that you should watch for fun, like Plane 2023. Cinema is the art of conversation, but it is also an enjoyable experience. Each movie has a specific goal for viewers. This movie is for entertainment purpose.",

            "A fascinating film with potential that was never fully achieved. \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d does not rely solely on shock value to disturb its audience; instead, it uses the horrors of war to sober them with facts and dismal realities. The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is. Fans of the genre, or anyone who appreciates a well-made film, should not miss this film despite its limitations.\r\n___\r\nRating: ***7.5/10*** *(Impressive, yet it doesn't quite hit the mark in every respect)*",
            "All Quiet on the Western Front is as beautiful and poetic as it is brutal and blunt. Historically accurate, emotional, and raw, this film is easily the best war drama to arrive since \"Saving Private Ryan\". Although available in English over dub, watching the film in the native German language with English subtitles is the way to go. Somehow, hearing German commanding officers shouting in English doesn't have the same dramatic effect. The cinematography is amazing. Go watch it.",
            "All Quiet on the Western Front is a dark, gritty, and depressing look at what the effects of war and propaganda have on the soldiers who enlist.\r\n\r\nOur main characters enter the front all bright eyed and bushy tailed excited to fight for Germany, mainly due to them being naive about what war is truly like. That optimism is soon destroyed in the first minutes of reaching the battlefields as they are hit with mortar strikes that kill countless numbers of their comrades. This is where we first get to see the incredible emotion portrayed in this film. The actors do so much with just their facial expressions to demonstrate their mental decay as the turmoil of war inflict their damage.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant theme of the destruction of peace throughout the entire film, whether be the peace of Germany as a whole due to the lackluster treaty they are forced to sign or the disturbance within the troop themselves. Every time our main characters have a sense of calm, like having a pleasant chat while on guard duty or stealing chickens from a local farmer, that calm is interrupted by more death and destruction. These lulls in action provide a sense of comfortability for the audience that gets ripped away in a second's notice. This juxtaposition occurs throughout the entire film, and I found in incredibly effective.\r\n\r\nThe tension of war is aided with a brilliant score. The subtle piano keys mixed with loud bass crashes create an uneasiness that spells impending doom for our main troop. It was quite excellent.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the performances here are downright incredible. Felix Kammerer was brilliant in his leading role. His evolution from an absolute wreck of soldier, crying and panicking on the battlefield to grizzled vet who is able to run headfirst into battle without a second notice was fantastic. But he still kept the sweet and genuine attitude throughout, having moments of clarity during the battle where he realizes the brutality of what he and his other soldiers are doing. These complex emotions are carried over to the majority of the cast and was one of my favorite parts about this film.\r\n\r\nOverall, All Quiet on the Western Front was a major surprise for me. I am not super experienced nor am interested in many war films, but this may have changed my tune because I genuinely believe it is one of the best movies of the year.\r\n\r\nScore: 94%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",
            "This is the first major film that I have seen where the undoubted atrocities of the Great War trench battles were presented from the side of Germany. More specifically, from the young \"B\u00e4umer\" (the thoroughly convincing Felix Kammerer) who finds himself along with comrades \"M\u00fcller\" (Moritz Klaus) and \"Albert\" (Aaron Hilmer) enlisting into the army. Full of enthusiasm and optimism they arrive at a front that very quickly saps them all of both. Food is in short supply, as is sleep, water, safety - indeed just about everything that could terrify these young men is delivered upon them as, meantime, we (the audience) see a parallel storyline that shows just how close to armistice we are at this stage of this most egregious conflict. If you've ever been to the Somme, you will probably conclude just as \"B\u00e4umer\" does, that there is an immense degree of futility in men fighting for a few yards of bombed out, muddy and corpse-ridden ground. The toing and froing between these equally matched, tired and disillusioned troops demonstrating the pointlessness of it all. Edward Berger marries the strife and struggles faced by those at the front well with the diplomatic efforts being made by those whose discomfort was of an entirely different cut. Daniel Br\u00fchl and, to a lesser extent, Thibault de Montalembert go some way to illustrating this parallel game of chess with one side determined to salvage some semblance of honour in defeat, the other determined that victory will be complete and absolute. The visual effects are not quite \"1917\" (2019), but they still convey excellently the peril and squalor in which these soldiers endured. The audio mixes add perfectly to that sense of menace, and the whole cinematography strikes a chill. The screenplay is sparing; we do not have loads of dialogue - much of the imagery and the facial expressions of the young men, scared out of their wits for much of the time, is left to do almost all of the heavy lifting. It is brutal and graphic at times, but that adds enormously to this frankly terrifyingly authentic look at warfare that pits man against the elements and, ultimately, the politics superbly. Big screen must, if you can. Netflix it may be, but for television this certainly isn't.",
            "**Demonizing war leaders VS angel soldiers**\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful and simple moments in the life of a person who loves cinema is watching this movie without any expectations and he comes out of this movie with a very high fascination. I was related to war events, especially World War I and World War II. Naturally, this thing made me related to war movies.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, simply this movie that we are talking about entered my list among the best movies I have seen in my life, and the reason is because it is different from any other movie.\r\n\r\nIt is very ironic from the beginning of the film, and you see to what degree the name of the movie doesn't at all indicate that things are calm between the Germans and the French, but it is important that through the events of the film we will live the quiet and deadly events of the soldiers on the Western Front between the Germans and the French.\r\n\r\nYou will live the events of this war from the perspective of young Germans, and you will see and discover that this giant evil devil in Europe, who is always blamed for all wars, whether World War I or World War II, is made up of young human soldiers in the prime of their lives, coordinated behind policies and resounding slogans. The most important point is that in every A war has victims and perpetrators on both sides.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important advantages of the film is the German side, because you will live the events of the movie through German actors, and this is a precedent in war films for me, which will increase the realism of the film\u2019s story. Despite my lack of knowledge of the German language, I decided to bring subtitle of the movie.\r\n\r\nWe will live with multiple personalities from the moment German youths register for the army, through their entry into the battlefield, and you will see the long nights of war and many German youths who have simple aspirations and dreams, in addition to how true friendship will be formed between members of the army in this lonely place.\r\n\r\nThe impact of losing friends during the battle in a sudden, brutal and realistic way. What I liked the most about the movie is the war aspect. My body shivered many times while watching it, because you usually see in traditional war movies you often find plans, strategies, battles and heroic stances, but this movie is like (1917 movie at 2019). We live with simple soldiers in the battle. The movie tells us the details of the horrors of the battle experienced by every soldier.\r\n\r\nThe film succeeded in demonizing wars and war leaders, and at the same time humanizing all the soldiers present in wars.",
            "This movie has nothing to do with the original book. It was created by the order of German politicians in attempt to make the world believe that Germans didn't want war and justify WW2 by humiliating peace treaty Germans were \"forced\" to sign. It is disgusting that country responsible for not one but TWO wars that ruined millions of lives wants to make everyone believe that they're pacifists and victims. If you don't believe me find out how they teach history in German schools. Millennials don't even know that Germans were killing Jews and even if some were killed, it was not more than in other countries of that time. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, it's not a movie, not adaptation of the book but simply propaganda, waste of time and brainwash that you paid for.",
            "All Quiet on the Western Front by Edward Berger is an intense, unfiltered look at the brutal reality of World War I.\r\n\r\nThe movie follows a young German soldier, Paul, who goes from eager and full of hope to completely changed by the horrors he faces on the battlefield. It\u2019s heavy, and it doesn\u2019t shy away from showing just how brutal trench warfare was.\r\n\r\nOne thing that really hit me was how the film makes you feel trapped along with the soldiers. The cinematography is amazing but also relentless, capturing the mud, the cold, and the constant fear of death. Edward Berger does an incredible job pulling you into that world. It\u2019s not an easy movie to watch, and it doesn\u2019t try to glorify anything. Instead, it shows the cost of war on a personal level, especially for young soldiers who were basically kids when they signed up.\r\n\r\nPerfect if you want a movie that\u2019s powerful, thought-provoking, and leaves you a little shaken.",
            "<em>'All Quiet on the Western Front'</em> is a hauntingly brilliant epic anti-war picture. The only things I knew coming into watching it (aside from the obvious) is that it won many awards, particularly for its sound and visuals - both of which are indeed of very high quality.\r\n\r\nThere aren't many noteworthy criticisms I can really level at this movie, that's not to say it's absolutely perfect of course - e.g. that one <em>'Transformers'</em>-esque piece of the score is ill-fitting. It is, though, simply a film of high calibre. Everyone of the cast merits props by the way, particularly Felix Kammerer and Albrecht Schuch.\r\n\r\nOne to recommend, without question."

Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.\r\n\r\nMaybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine. From one of the film poster, I thought it was Michael Sheen. Only realised while watching the film that it was Guy Pearce. From writing to the making, it was a very good film. But the story could make some people uneasy. Because everything that's happened between the people and their relationship, not for soft guys.

I could not make it through 20 minutes before I had to shut it off.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie which seems determined to slander the most beautiful message that exists - the message of Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nIt is also another point of evidence that rated \"R\" and \"MA\" movies simply means \"movies not worth poisoning your brain with\".\r\n\r\nThe actors were great.

            "**A good Western, despite its weaknesses.**\r\n\r\nMany decades ago, Italian Western films were a huge success and guaranteed the careers of several actors, such as Clint Eastwood, and directors like Sergio Leone. This film, however, is neither Italian nor American: despite being spoken in English and featuring North American actors, it is a film directed by the Dutch (Martin Koolhoven and his team), shot in Spain and where Hungarians and Austrians also collaborated. Out of this Babel of nationalities, however, emerged a good Western film.\r\n\r\nThe plot is the strongest point of this film, which wonderfully works the epic style and a tension that grows, chapter by chapter (was I the only one to see in this chapter organization and non-linear narrative some influence by Tarantino?). I won't reveal too much about the plot, but I think I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment if I say that everything revolves around a young woman who tries to escape from a crazed Protestant pastor who is determined to kill her, no matter the place or the circumstances. The film builds an absolutely detestable and maniacal villain, and gives the female character the gifts and strength to defeat him, and to captivate us with sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe film is not perfect, there are logic flaws, continuity flaws and absurd situations. But the film nevertheless entertains the audience very well. Guy Pearce stands out the most, giving life to a captivating and execrable villain. The actor is excellent and gives us the best work of his career so far. Dakota Fanning holds the central female character and handles the task at hand well, but I felt several times that she doesn't have a challenging task. Kit Harrington can complain even more, since he saw his character killed early and didn't have time to show talent, despite the film being almost two and a half hours long.\r\n\r\nRegarding the length, I am of the opinion that it would have been better with about thirty minutes less, and that this denotes a certain sloppiness in the editing and in the selection of the scenes that should have been in the final cut. The film is impactful, it is quite violent, realistic and not suitable for teenagers, impressionable people and animal lovers (as far as I know, no one was hurt in the filming, but there are several intense scenes that include animals). The sets and costumes were very well-designed, despite the fact that the film works in a certain temporal limbo in which it is very difficult to have a sense of the time in which everything happens (somewhere between 1880 and 1910?). The scenarios are also very good, and the soundtrack was very well conceived.",
            "Yeah, another Western, had to wait for the wife to not be home so I could dive into a genre she hates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's odd how sex and nudity seem out of place in westerns given that in real life prostitution thrived. Historically a lot of what this film is about could be true. But... it doesn't feel like it should be in a Western. Racism and violence, yeah, those can make it in and feel right. Prostitution, certainly... but in a not seen sort of way.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know, it's a lot of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart with Clint Eastwood bringing up the rear that sort of defines the genre for people my age.\r\n\r\nThat being said... it's dark.\r\n\r\nBut it's done right, and it's well acted, and it plays on the emotions something fierce, it's well acted, it's moody. In other words it's an insanely well done movie, despite that fact that it deals with subject matter that you don't expect coming into a western.\r\n\r\nInsanely well done."

It is one of the great films of German cinema, one of the best productions that were made before the Second World War and one of the best films in the career of the renowned director Fritz Lang, who shortly afterward would leave Germany due to the rise of Nazism, refusing to deal with that political regime.\r\n\r\nThe film is inspired by real events, namely the murderous path of Peter K\u00fcrten, the \u201cVampire of D\u00fcsseldorf\u201d, who terrorized people at the same time and also had young teenagers as his victims. The film manages to capture very well the feeling of fear that existed among the people of the city and the attempts that the police made to find this merciless killer.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography, in black and white, still shows signs of the influence of German expressionism without, however, giving up the realism that the entire film demanded. In fact, I can't say whether the film was inspired by \u201cnoir\u201d or came to inspire \u201cnoir\u201d later, but I could see the aesthetic and style similarities.

            "Viewers beware: this is not an easy or light watch.\r\n\r\nMads Mikkelsen absolutely kills it as a somewhat lonely single man, who suddenly finds love and welcomes his son to live with him.\r\n\r\nThat's all I'll reveal in the review, no spoilers here.\r\n\r\nBut again, this isn't a light film, nor should it be. This tackles the subject matter with the poise it deserves, with stunning performances from Mads as well as the entire supporting cast. The script and cinematography lend themselves perfectly to the task at hand, delivering a well-crafted portrayal of love, friendship, and ruin.\r\n\r\nExcellent.",
            "Happy to file this one under 'Films I Evidently Didn't Get'.\r\n\r\n<b>[Edit: I can't lie, I'm absolutely waffling below. Apologies in advance and totally feel free to ignore, I just typed whatever came into my head because I'm simply so unsure about this. I've articulated myself awfully I'm positive, way too many paragraphs and all that but hey-ho.]</b>\r\n\r\nI don't even know where to start with <em>'The Hunt'</em>, I'm finding it difficult to seperate my thoughts. On the one hand I dislike a lot about this, from the writing to the pacing to the supposed message of it and from the clearly phenomenal acting.\r\n\r\nI usually solely focus on my own opinions and type up my review before reading others', but every now and then a film comes along that I just don't get and when it's one with surprisingly (to me) high acclaim I have to read other reviews to see if I've just simply missed something glaringly obvious - which is, even now, entirely possible, don't get me wrong.\r\n\r\nHowever, the vibe of a handful of reviews on here I've seen is either hate the kid(s) or hate the people for believing the kid(s)... surely that's not the point of the film? I'm aware this is perhaps too UK-centric a reference, but if that is the case it is giving major Tory/Brexit/GB News vibes. As in, it's (hate this word, but...) some sorta 'wokery', we must get rid of cancel culture and all that stupid rhetoric.\r\n\r\nPre-reading reviews, I just simply didn't understand what the film was trying to say... and even by stating whatever, why it went around the houses for nearly two hours and then proceded to not even wrap it up. I personally found it exhausting to watch, I admittedly don't tend to enjoy films that attempt these sorta 'smart' open-ended endings.\r\n\r\nIf all the film is trying to say is that people can sometimes be falsely accused and have their lifes ruined by mob mentality, then fine... but I'm not sure using child abuse is quite the way to portray that idea. It's hardly a regular real life occurrence of children (very young children, at that) ruining grown mens lifes with sexual assault claims, is it?\r\n\r\nThat's what I mean with what I said three paragraphs back, it's like you see on social media when a well known person is alleged to have done something serious and you get that section of people who immediately hate the likely victim for no reason.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps I'm unsure about this 2012 release as I'm judging through my 2023 eyes, as in the aforementioned online rhetoric has murked the waters in terms of what the film is actually trying to say. Nowadays it's closely associated with those who use the terms 'woke', 'snowflake' etc. and that makes me feel uncomfortable, I can't lie.\r\n\r\nNow, even all that aside, solely as film I still didn't really enjoy it either. The way parts are written and characters act annoyed me, e.g. the shop scene. From them all willing to fight Lucas one second to the next when they're all scared because he head-butted someone; and how they didn't see that coming, or Lucas himself didn't see the initial punch coming. I acknowledge that's a random example, but it kinda typifies how odd the film felt to me at most moments.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I do have one positive and that is the acting - which is truly top notch, frustratingly so if anything as it makes it difficult for me to rate the film. Mads Mikkelsen is truly outstanding, one of the best performances I've seen from him thus far. Thomas Bo Larsen is quality as well. No-one on the cast puts a foot wrong in truth, even youngster Annika Wedderkopp or the more experienced Anne Louise Hassing.\r\n\r\nI get severely awkward when I'm rating a film so much lower than the majority, which doesn't happen all that often at all but when it does it makes me cringe. I'm just being honest in how I feel though, even if it's totally possible that I've just got the wrong end of the stick completely. If I have, so be it.",

            "Although this is set amidst a small rural community, it could just as easily transfer to any society where a small white lie can lead to a misunderstanding that brings out the vigilante in any of us. That\u2019s the situation that primary school teacher \u201cLucas\u201d (Mads Mikkelsen) finds himself in when the young daughter of his childhood friend \u201cTheo\u201d (Thomas Bo Larsen) makes a remark that turns this otherwise peaceable community into something distinctly hostile. You can probably guess that nature of the accusation, and perhaps comprehend just why people closed ranks and gave \u201cLucas\u201d little opportunity to address the issue, especially as there were no obvious methods of corroborating either person\u2019s version of events about which the worst is assumed of this hitherto liked and respected man. To add to the woes of the teacher, he is simultaneously trying to re-establish a relationship with his teenage son \u201cMarcus\u201d (Lasse Fogelstr\u00f8m) who is, himself, a friend of the accuser and her family. Over the best part of two hours we now see just how effective the whole process of ostracism can be. The refusal to engage, the denial of facilities and services, the overwhelming pressures of being guilty - regardless of authoritative investigation or chance for explanation or vindication. How can he get back in? Mikkelsen delivers compellingly here and the story and the dialogue becomes more desperate, harrowing even, as the story builds to a tense and unpredictable conclusion. Larsen displays a conflicted friend/father effectively and Fogelstr\u00f8m likewise as a conflicted son, and Thomas Vinterberg contrives to deliver a meticulously paced and shocking indictment of the effects of this exclusion in both a violent but mainly psychological fashion. It\u2019s a tough watch, this film - but well worth it and it does beg the question about what might our own behaviour be in similar circumstances."

Yes, you get a weird realtor and a creepy kid but other than that you just watch the couple basically repeat each day hating being stuck.

            "> **_Review on Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nThis indie sci-fi thriller Vivarium from Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is many things, one definitely being quite the head-scratcher. Not because of it being an intellectually challenging story, or one that is laced with twists and turns to create an unpredictable viewing, but a film that delivers a narratives so peculiar that it is like something you've never seen before. Take this with a pinch of salt, as there's certainly aspects which don't make the landing of such an ambitious plot, but let it also be known that Vivarium contains some impressions visual and narrative storytelling, enough to forgive some of the mid-act waffle that cripples the films momentum.\r\n\r\nFinnegan gets the ball rolling with power, keeping the story taught enough that we are thrown straight into the mystery early doors. This works extremely well as the tension begins to bubble within the first ten minute mark. The performances here from our main cast member already begin to show their brilliance, especially Jonathon Aris who sets a chilling foreshadowing tone with his appropriately eerie character Martin. The small (yet effective) amount of screen time we have with Martin is enough to set the tone, and we, like Tom and Gemma are forced to endure something that is so ominously intense that it leaves a lingering sense of dread.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this soon begins to simmer once Finnegan establishes the plot in its whole, and realisation settles on the simple fact that, after the 30 minute mark, there really isn't much else for the story to go. Yes the labyrinth maze of suburbia is strangely terrifying, and the strenuous repetition is effective, but after 15 minutes of having the child introduced, Vivarium begins to fall flat, and grow increasingly more stale up until after the sixty minutes in. The fantastic Poots and Eisenberg, and the deadpan humour do prevent this film from becoming a little too one-note, but this doesn't exuse more than a few scenes that will be a task to sit through, even in these current homebound world we are living in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a glimmer of brilliance in Finnegan's choice of release here, as what our main couple are enduring is poetically reflective of the life we are living in this mad pandemic virus. I found myself identifying with the irritated attitude our characters develop, and sympathised with them when their child (the boy) was well deserving of a slap. Vivarium is intelligently relative right now, and can definitely be perceived as as Finnegan holding a mirror up to the idealistic yet treacherous concept of what makes the perfect home, and the urge to be the perfect family.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there's so much underlying aspects of Vivarium that are so incredibly reflective of the inevitable repetition that comes once a spunky couple are weighed down by family life, securing their \"ideal\" home and tolerating each others impurities under the same roof constantly. Finnegan exposes the dangers of the nuclear family here, and forces us to endure it too, warts and all. We even get those little moments in which Tom consistently chips away, digging a whole, not to be talked to, helped or interrupted by Gemma, who becomes a slave to ensuring nothing but contentment for their boy. This moment is humourous with a dark sting, and will be reflective of reality to many, but to those inside Vivarium is nothing but a nightmarish loop.\r\n\r\nThis distorted utopia Finnegan creates is what's most effective, orchestrated by a Burton-esque palette that is as gorgeous as it is hauntingly off-kilter. The early 80's, Romero's Day of the \r\n\r\nDead-like synth is undeniably effective, and carries the tension through to the final act, which although doesn't hit a payoff point that excuses the slow middle act, does add to the bankers reality Finnegan has crafted, and highlights the eeriness established from the beginning. While Vivarium does lose a tone of momentum when it hits the mid-way point, by the time it reaches its end, I can't shake the distinct feeling of unease I had to endure for over eighty minutes, and I can't deny that a film like this was an experience I have quite been exposed to before. I have been feeling really under the weather these past few days, and let's just say this only made me feel worse. Great job, I guess?\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nVivarium is a simplistically disturbing suburban nightmare with a captivating story and little room for growth. Enduring its drab middle act may prove tricky, but once Finnegan blows the dust of the eerie intensity established from the beginning, you'll find there is much to be desired with this unsettling little indie-sci-fi thriller.",
            "Amazing watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nImogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg (both from \"The Art of Self Defense\") are amazing in their roles as an abducted couple force to raise a child.\r\n\r\nThis is an amazing premise (see \"Solar Opposites\" for something similar), and one that is extremely hard to discuss without spoilers. This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is \"adoption of a strange child\" trope, there is a \"troubled couple\" trope, there is even a mystery trope.\r\n\r\nI'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different \"Twilight Zone\" episodes.\r\n\r\nThe production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through.",
            "Sci-fi thriller, just not _\"on the edge of sit\"_ type. Lorcan Finnegan remakes his short film **Foxes** and adds a life message to it.",
            "It's a movie whose premise had promise but was never thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nI read the generally high praise in the reviews for this movie and admittedly, I was fooled. I'm convinced that at least the individual here who likened part of its premise to the animated series, \"Solar Opposites,\" while not being entirely off the mark, neglected to mention that unlike Solar Opposites, there is no payoff with Vivarium. Unlike Solar Opposites, we don't know why Vivarium exists. We don't know why people are expected to raise these mysterious hominids. We don't know what their purpose is, other than to entrap first home buyers, like some kind of otherworldly predatory lender. Is it a euphemism for unscrupulous property developers? Who knows?\r\n\r\nOnly thing I know is that by the end of it all, I felt totally ripped off. At around 90 minutes, it was 60 minutes too long. It's not even something that I can suggest is open to much interpretation.\r\n\r\nIf you just need something playing in the background while you're performing other work at home, even then it may be a stretch but it certainly doesn't deserve much better.",
            "Vivarium was eerie and creepy, and definitely a movie that will mess with your head, albeit probably in ways other than you anticipated. You'll be tricked in the beginning into believing this movie is actually a sociological observation of the slow and robotic death of suburban life: you and your nuclear family settle into middle class conformity in a large, seemingly endless design of mazes and hedges, condemned to repeat the endless cycle of home, school (or work), home, sleep, rinse and repeat. And it certainly gives one those unsettling vibes, especially when the creepy box with the build-a-baby arrives at their prison doorsteps.\r\n\r\nRather, this is something else entirely. While it does well maintaining that nearly subtle sense of wrongness, of something being terribly just _off_, in the end, you may find yourself somewhat disappointed, as it is at this precise moment the film becomes like every other movie of its kind out there. Quite possibly, it is the end that is the most disturbing, for it seems to insinuate that humanity is as disposable as livestock.",
            "A young couple go to an estate agent to seek out their dream home. They encounter the almost robotic \"Martin\" who offers to show them their ideal residence - and so off go Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg to inspect. They discover a typical detached house in the suburbs, surrounded by identical homes that leave them a bit cold. When their guide disappears, they decide to go home - except; they are caught in a labyrinthine network of streets that always brings them back to \"No. 9\". Soon, a baby in a box arrives and their happiness ought to be complete - except they have no other human contact and so slowly, but surely, start to go a bid mad. The kid has an infuriating habit of screaming loudly when he doesn't get what he wants - and I felt much like screaming myself as the cyclical pointlessness of this really dreary film did start to get on my nerves. Perhaps Lorcan Finnegan intended the potency of the sterility of the whole thing to engender a feeling of irritation from his audience; if he did then top marks. Otherwise, this is a total waste of the talents of two actors who could have found better ways to help us pass 100 minutes.",
            "\"Vivarium\" is one of those movies that pulls you in with an interesting concept but leaves you questioning everything, especially the choices the characters make. The story follows a couple who find themselves trapped in a seemingly endless suburban neighborhood, forced into a bizarre and unsettling routine. The mystery keeps you engaged, but the characters\u2019 decisions often feel frustrating. Not in a \"bad script\" way, but in a way that makes you wonder if they were written to be this passive on purpose. The pacing leans toward slow-burn horror, relying more on psychological unease than traditional scares.\r\n\r\nThe directing does a solid job of maintaining tension, making the whole thing feel claustrophobic and surreal. The cinematography enhances this with sterile, repetitive visuals that emphasize the artificiality of their world. Acting-wise, Imogen Poots delivers a strong performance, while Jesse Eisenberg brings his usual style, which sometimes works but occasionally feels forced. The real standout is the child actor, his unsettling presence adds a lot to the film\u2019s eerie atmosphere. There\u2019s a lot of subtlety in how he moves and reacts, making you wonder whether his voice was altered or dubbed over in post.\r\n\r\nThe script keeps things cryptic, and while that works for the tone, it also leaves some moments feeling underdeveloped. The lack of clear explanations may frustrate some viewers, but it\u2019s clear that the movie is more about the experience than the answers. The sound design plays a big role in the tension, using unsettling audio cues to make certain scenes even more uncomfortable. Overall, Vivarium is a strange, thought-provoking film that raises more questions than it answers. If you like psychological horror with a heavy dose of surrealism, it\u2019s worth a watch. Just don\u2019t expect everything to make sense."

            "*don't waste your time*. Most of the movie happens in a sort of multi-floor prison where the top levels can control the food that goes to the bottom floors. This created a sort of class structure where top-levelers had pleasure on denying food to the bottom levels, although the floors were sorted periodically. The protagonist started to question this structure and tried to change it. Although starting well, the movie lost its track trying to be too much symbolic and enigmatic.

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nNetflix has been supporting small, independent filmmaking for a while now. In 2018, Roma (re)opened a Best Picture nomination path to foreign films. Last year, Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman could only come to life via streaming since no major studio wanted a three-and-a-half-hour runtime for a theater release. Between these two, dozens of other indie flicks got Netflix's (or other streaming networks) support. 2020 brings us a Spanish horror-thriller from a first-time director (Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia): The Platform (or El Hoyo).\r\n\r\nSince its showing at TIFF, this movie has been receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. So, obviously, I needed to add it to my list. I watched it a couple of days ago, and I wanted to take time to think about it because it's definitely going to become a divisive film, especially among general audiences. The Platform carries an extremely abstract narrative, filled with symbolism, metaphors, analogies, and allegories to our political-social-economic situation. It's not a straightforward thriller at all.\r\n\r\nIt's a tremendously intriguing concept, developed through captivating storytelling and a very dark tone. It's a prison that resembles our society of today. Filled with hypocrisy and selfishness. One month, you're the king of the world on a level where food comes in excess, but you still want it all for yourself, ignoring desperate requests from down below. As soon as in the next day, you're a miserable human being, fighting for scraps with your \"cellmate\", and on the exact same position those desperate people were before... And now you want their help?!\r\n\r\nThat last narrative analogy to the real world is undoubtedly my favorite. I was never a fan of politics (who is?), so analogies and symbolism regarding that part of our life don't really impact me. However, it's clear that the screenwriters put a lot of effort into making such a meaningful story. If the ambiguousness is removed from the screenplay, there's still plenty to enjoy. Goreng's arc goes from just trying to get a diploma to actually save the people from lower levels. His story takes the viewer through tons of violence, blood, gore, and genuinely disgusting sequences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, people who want straight-up popcorn-action instead of a more philosophical take as the filmmakers intended, there's a lot to be entertained by. The Platform is also another proof that you don't need a massive budget to build an immersive atmosphere. The set and production design are as simple as they could be, but it's especially due to that simplicity that the claustrophobic prison works so well. For a directorial debut, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia does an excellent job of controlling the pacing and applying the right shots to each situation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my main issue is the same as most people: the ending. I will restrain myself from giving away any minor spoilers, so I'll just write that it doesn't work at all levels, at least not for me. As expected, it's as ambiguous as the rest of the movie. As soon as I finished the film, I was frustrated by so many unanswered (logical) questions, and after a couple of days of thinking about it, these questions still exist. You'll never find an answer to everything, but that was never the main goal. There has to be a balance between reality and fiction. Between what's real and what's just a metaphoric symbol. No one can justify *everything* with \"oh, it's just a representation of something else\".\r\n\r\nFor me, there are two ways of interpreting the ending: I could either take everything literally, which would raise tons of questions without an answer, or I could try and solely look at the story through Goreng's perspective. I do believe the latter approach is the best one, even if it still carries other issues regarding secondary characters. It doesn't answer everything, but it's the perspective I find to make more sense with the movie. It makes the screenplay more cohesive and congruent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the problem I can't seem to avoid is the abrupt break in tone. For such a brutal, raw, bloody display of human behavior in a situation of survival (the way colors are used is very clever), the climax feels detached from everything that comes before. The underlying themes are there from the get-go, but these are precisely what they are: secondary messages lying under a pretty real story. Going from horrible murders, sacrifices, and God knows what else, to such a philosophical, soulful ending in the way the film does... it's far from a seamless transition.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you go in expecting definite answers about whatever this prison is, who controls it, and how it truly works, you'll probably leave disappointed and frustrated. It's one of those movies that heavily relies on how people perceive its ending and how much impact does it cause on an overall opinion. Looking at the conclusion solely from Goreng's perspective works the best for me, even if some unanswered (logical) questions still exist. The abrupt break in tone transitioning to the film's climax is my main problem, but The Platform has plenty of positives. An extremely intriguing premise is developed through remarkably captivating storytelling, and an exceptional cast elevates the well-written screenplay. First-time director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and his team do an excellent job. Set and production design prove how a small budget can still create an immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere. Even if the ending only works partially, the symbolism and allegories of our world's politics and social-economic situation are a brilliant, thought-provoking piece of a screenplay. I like more it the more I think about it.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "A fantastic watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is a survivalist movie, heavy with philosophy of morality.  A lot of the time when I get to say anything close to that, I get to say, \"but there is humor too\", there is not: not traditional humor anyways.\r\n\r\nThis is a dark movie filled with metaphor and cruel reality.  Now while I am usually offended by reality encroaching on my escapism, that is normally when I'm trying to watch dirt humor.  When to take a concept like this, the relation to reality only strengthens the movie.\r\n\r\n\"Those above, and those below\" is something to think about, and if that intrigues you or you're already onboard for a philosophical discussion of anti-hierarchical class society structure, or intrigue by the idea that it doesn't matter who or when someone is in the class structure: it defeats the society just by being.\r\n\r\nThe production value is minimal but sufficient, and I think that is by design.  It does live in the land of bad dubs, but not enough for me to fault it.\r\n\r\nGive this a shot: you might be surprised at yourself or your company.",
            "Rate: zero\r\n\r\nThis is what happens when we build a house for a door (instead of building a house and then put doors in it); An exotic, dirty and cluttered movie. Dirty but not necessarily in the visual meaning but in the cinematic meant. The director does not know what he wants to do at all, the camera angles, the frames, the compositions and everything are completely in the air, he just knows he wants to beat capitalism but he does not know how and for this purpose, which is what He does not do well, he comes to the great art of cinema and insults it with this film. A film must first become a cinematic work and then speak, first a house must be built and then several doors must be left for it, it is not possible to throw an ideology in the middle and make a film around it, of course, if it is possible to call this film, a film! Symbolism and the use of symbols are correct when the director does not shout with every dialogue and every scene that this object is a symbol! The symbol should not be completely revealed to be a symbol. If he is going to make a symbolic film, he must first know how, then put signs in his symbols, not to turn the whole film into a bunch of ridiculous symbols. From one place, the director does not even remember what his goal was and enters another phase, which he thinks is a revolution. Not only he does not understand and show the revolution, but he forces his two main characters, who are not characters at all, to beat everyone so that they can only get food to the final stage! you are kidding! How do these movements represent revolution, leftism, and helping others? They go downstairs and beat everyone, and finally they feed their ridiculous symbol (the dessert) to the child and send him down to, for example, when she returns to the top floor, the tyrants become surprised! So what? what will happen! Did the film become a leftist film? Did it promote revolution and resistance? Did it help everyone and save them? Never. In general, it can be said that \"Platform\" is a disgusting, ridiculous and shameless film that insults both the cinema and its audience, and there is no cinematic or ideal value in it, and in the humblest case, even a slogan.",

            "*don't waste your time*. Most of the movie happens in a sort of multi-floor prison where the top levels can control the food that goes to the bottom floors. This created a sort of class structure where top-levelers had pleasure on denying food to the bottom levels, although the floors were sorted periodically. The protagonist started to question this structure and tried to change it. Although starting well, the movie lost its track trying to be too much symbolic and enigmatic. The ending was very disappointing leaving too many loose ends that should have been closed.",
            "A violent form of demonstration of the problems of capitalist society. Despite the fact that the level of violence is too much for me, I understand purpose of it for narration. Actually I find this film quite spiritual. The parallel between Jesus and Christian values is quite obvious.",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nNetflix has been supporting small, independent filmmaking for a while now. In 2018, Roma (re)opened a Best Picture nomination path to foreign films. Last year, Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman could only come to life via streaming since no major studio wanted a three-and-a-half-hour runtime for a theater release. Between these two, dozens of other indie flicks got Netflix's (or other streaming networks) support. 2020 brings us a Spanish horror-thriller from a first-time director (Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia): The Platform (or El Hoyo).\r\n\r\nSince its showing at TIFF, this movie has been receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. So, obviously, I needed to add it to my list. I watched it a couple of days ago, and I wanted to take time to think about it because it's definitely going to become a divisive film, especially among general audiences. The Platform carries an extremely abstract narrative, filled with symbolism, metaphors, analogies, and allegories to our political-social-economic situation. It's not a straightforward thriller at all.\r\n\r\nIt's a tremendously intriguing concept, developed through captivating storytelling and a very dark tone. It's a prison that resembles our society of today. Filled with hypocrisy and selfishness. One month, you're the king of the world on a level where food comes in excess, but you still want it all for yourself, ignoring desperate requests from down below. As soon as in the next day, you're a miserable human being, fighting for scraps with your \"cellmate\", and on the exact same position those desperate people were before... And now you want their help?!\r\n\r\nThat last narrative analogy to the real world is undoubtedly my favorite. I was never a fan of politics (who is?), so analogies and symbolism regarding that part of our life don't really impact me. However, it's clear that the screenwriters put a lot of effort into making such a meaningful story. If the ambiguousness is removed from the screenplay, there's still plenty to enjoy. Goreng's arc goes from just trying to get a diploma to actually save the people from lower levels. His story takes the viewer through tons of violence, blood, gore, and genuinely disgusting sequences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, people who want straight-up popcorn-action instead of a more philosophical take as the filmmakers intended, there's a lot to be entertained by. The Platform is also another proof that you don't need a massive budget to build an immersive atmosphere. The set and production design are as simple as they could be, but it's especially due to that simplicity that the claustrophobic prison works so well. For a directorial debut, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia does an excellent job of controlling the pacing and applying the right shots to each situation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my main issue is the same as most people: the ending. I will restrain myself from giving away any minor spoilers, so I'll just write that it doesn't work at all levels, at least not for me. As expected, it's as ambiguous as the rest of the movie. As soon as I finished the film, I was frustrated by so many unanswered (logical) questions, and after a couple of days of thinking about it, these questions still exist. You'll never find an answer to everything, but that was never the main goal. There has to be a balance between reality and fiction. Between what's real and what's just a metaphoric symbol. No one can justify *everything* with \"oh, it's just a representation of something else\".\r\n\r\nFor me, there are two ways of interpreting the ending: I could either take everything literally, which would raise tons of questions without an answer, or I could try and solely look at the story through Goreng's perspective. I do believe the latter approach is the best one, even if it still carries other issues regarding secondary characters. It doesn't answer everything, but it's the perspective I find to make more sense with the movie. It makes the screenplay more cohesive and congruent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the problem I can't seem to avoid is the abrupt break in tone. For such a brutal, raw, bloody display of human behavior in a situation of survival (the way colors are used is very clever), the climax feels detached from everything that comes before. The underlying themes are there from the get-go, but these are precisely what they are: secondary messages lying under a pretty real story. Going from horrible murders, sacrifices, and God knows what else, to such a philosophical, soulful ending in the way the film does... it's far from a seamless transition.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you go in expecting definite answers about whatever this prison is, who controls it, and how it truly works, you'll probably leave disappointed and frustrated. It's one of those movies that heavily relies on how people perceive its ending and how much impact does it cause on an overall opinion. Looking at the conclusion solely from Goreng's perspective works the best for me, even if some unanswered (logical) questions still exist. The abrupt break in tone transitioning to the film's climax is my main problem, but The Platform has plenty of positives. An extremely intriguing premise is developed through remarkably captivating storytelling, and an exceptional cast elevates the well-written screenplay. First-time director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and his team do an excellent job. Set and production design prove how a small budget can still create an immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere. Even if the ending only works partially, the symbolism and allegories of our world's politics and social-economic situation are a brilliant, thought-provoking piece of a screenplay. I like more it the more I think about it.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "A fantastic watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is a survivalist movie, heavy with philosophy of morality.  A lot of the time when I get to say anything close to that, I get to say, \"but there is humor too\", there is not: not traditional humor anyways.\r\n\r\nThis is a dark movie filled with metaphor and cruel reality.  Now while I am usually offended by reality encroaching on my escapism, that is normally when I'm trying to watch dirt humor.  When to take a concept like this, the relation to reality only strengthens the movie.\r\n\r\n\"Those above, and those below\" is something to think about, and if that intrigues you or you're already onboard for a philosophical discussion of anti-hierarchical class society structure, or intrigue by the idea that it doesn't matter who or when someone is in the class structure: it defeats the society just by being.\r\n\r\nThe production value is minimal but sufficient, and I think that is by design.  It does live in the land of bad dubs, but not enough for me to fault it.\r\n\r\nGive this a shot: you might be surprised at yourself or your company.",
            "Rate: zero\r\n\r\nThis is what happens when we build a house for a door (instead of building a house and then put doors in it); An exotic, dirty and cluttered movie. Dirty but not necessarily in the visual meaning but in the cinematic meant. The director does not know what he wants to do at all, the camera angles, the frames, the compositions and everything are completely in the air, he just knows he wants to beat capitalism but he does not know how and for this purpose, which is what He does not do well, he comes to the great art of cinema and insults it with this film. A film must first become a cinematic work and then speak, first a house must be built and then several doors must be left for it, it is not possible to throw an ideology in the middle and make a film around it, of course, if it is possible to call this film, a film! Symbolism and the use of symbols are correct when the director does not shout with every dialogue and every scene that this object is a symbol! The symbol should not be completely revealed to be a symbol. If he is going to make a symbolic film, he must first know how, then put signs in his symbols, not to turn the whole film into a bunch of ridiculous symbols. From one place, the director does not even remember what his goal was and enters another phase, which he thinks is a revolution. Not only he does not understand and show the revolution, but he forces his two main characters, who are not characters at all, to beat everyone so that they can only get food to the final stage! you are kidding! How do these movements represent revolution, leftism, and helping others? They go downstairs and beat everyone, and finally they feed their ridiculous symbol (the dessert) to the child and send him down to, for example, when she returns to the top floor, the tyrants become surprised! So what? what will happen! Did the film become a leftist film? Did it promote revolution and resistance? Did it help everyone and save them? Never. In general, it can be said that \"Platform\" is a disgusting, ridiculous and shameless film that insults both the cinema and its audience, and there is no cinematic or ideal value in it, and in the humblest case, even a slogan.",

As characters grapple with their desperate circumstances, a hero attempts to find hope by devising a plan to send a message to their captors and possibly save lives.

            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/society-of-the-snow-review-a-harrowing-tale/\r\n\r\n\"Society of the Snow unquestionably solidifies J. A. Bayona's status as an absurdly underrated filmmaker.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unbelievable, harrowing survival stories ever recreated, brought to life by a truly remarkable ensemble cast, breathtaking cinematography that captures the awe-inspiring yet treacherous landscapes, a deeply stirring score that tugs at the heartstrings, and a plane crash sequence like you've never seen before.\r\n\r\nThe convergence of these elements transforms an admittedly predictable survival piece into a visceral, emotionally resonant experience, urging audiences to reflect on the thoughtfully handled themes of human resilience, beliefs, and perseverance.\r\n\r\nA must-watch, especially on the big screen if possible.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "Society of the Snow is an incredible yet harrowing survival drama exemplifying true grit and trauma\r\n\r\nMy Score : 90/100\r\n\r\nBased on true events and a book by the same name, Society Of The Snow follows the story of a Uruguayan Rugby team whose plane crashes in the Andes Mountains while being on their way to Chile. Society of the Snow is haunting survival drama which accounts for the 70 days of the survivors in the sea of snow between the borders of Argentina and Chile. With a spine chilling screenplay and tragic events that follow, the film never feels 150mins long. I was just a hopeless spectator of the trauma the survivors went through. As gut wrenching and painful it may seem, the film efficiently exemplifies true grit and determination for survival which kept the Uruguyans going.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is incredibly good capturing some beautiful frames of the landscape while balancing it with tight close-ups that will evoke a sense of claustrophobia in you too. The editing is crisp and sharp wherein the length of the drama never bothered me. Director J.A. Bayona has excelled in focusing on the event rather than deep diving into character studies. His direction is top notch. Its a crime not to highlight the excellent sound design which shifts gears with tragic turn of events. Ensemble performances are fantastic and make it more realistic. The conversations are emotional and dialogues are equally well written which leaves a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nOverall, With a runtime of 145mins Society of the Snow shines as one of the most eventful screenplays of the genre that makes you gasp for your breath at various junctures of the narrative. It is intense, harsh and quite overwhelming thus making for an intriguing and incredible watch. Survival dramas at its finest. Spain\u2019s Official Entry to the Academy Awards this year and I cant agree more.\r\n\r\nInstagram & X : @streamgenx",
            "Pass me another piece of Society of the Snow. One shot of them walking the ridge made me nauseous. Mind-bending natural prison takes a while to come to light. Nice and personal, close shots keep the focus on the characters otherwise. Great crash scene. Ooohhhh my ankles.",
            "Pretty realistic movie of the events of the tragedy of the uruguayan flight with the that crashed in the Andes in 72, showing the strive for survival and realistic events that occurred (including the cannibalism as last resort for survival when the searches were stopped). \r\n\r\nThe film closed the 80th Venice International Film Festival, and was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 96th Academy Awards.\r\n\r\nThe flight was carrying 45 passengers and crew, including 19 members of the Old Christians Club rugby union team, along with their families, supporters and friends. Out of the initial crash, 33 people survived but with natural exposure, starvation, infection and other causes the final number was 16. This because, two survivors, Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa, climbed the 4,650-metre (15,260 ft) mountain peak on the western rim of the glacier cirque without any mountaineering gear whatsoever and hiked for 10 days into Chile to seek help, traveling 61 km (38 miles) to find a rescue team by helicopters. \r\n\r\nOn 23 December 1972, two months after the crash, all 16 remaining survivors were rescued. The news of their miraculous survival drew worldwide headlines and evolved into a media circus about the fact of cannibalism. \r\n\r\nThe director J. A. Bayona (The Orphanage, The Impossible, A Monster Calls, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom), discovered the book of one of the survivors while researching material for the Impossible and bought the rights for the book when he finished filming that movie, while taking more than 100h of interviews with the survivors, and was shoot in location around the crash site and into the actual crash site coasting mor than 60 million Euros. \r\n\r\nThe cinematography by Pedro Luque (Antbellum, Don't Breathe , Blue Beetle, The Girl into the Spider Web) is pretty gritty and realistic, and prosthetics by  David Mart\u00ed and Montse Rib\u00e9, Academy Award\u2013winning special effects makeup artists of Pan's Labyrinth were used.\r\n\r\nIn general the best of the movie depicting the events, in a more than realistic way than Alive.\r\n\r\nScore: 8.1 out of 10.0 / A-",
            "If you're at all familiar with Ethan Hawke's \"Alive\" (1993) then you'll have the gist of this story of the Uruguayan rugby team whose aircraft came down after heavy turbulence, stranding them amidst the wreckage high up in the Andes mountains. Of the forty who embarked, only sixteen remain and it now falls to them to demonstrate the ultimate in team spirit if they are to fight the cold, hunger, fear, avalanches and each other to survive. Juan Bayona has created a really uncomfortable film to watch here, engendering some strong performances from Enzo Vogrincic (Turcatti) and Agust\u00edn Pardella (Nando) as they are forced to drink melted snow and - well you can use your imagination as to how they had to find enough food to survive the sub-zero temperatures whilst - they hoped - help would find them. It's the pristine cinematography that helps this stand out - we really do get a sense of the hostility of this terrain, the cold and the dark; the cloud line making an airborne search for them all but impossible. Should some of them set off to search lower down or is their greater safety in numbers? It's history, so we do know what happened back in 1972 - but even that doesn't impact too much on the gradually increasing senses of peril, claustrophobia and terror and of the best and worst aspects of human nature when facing a crisis. An ensemble effort really, with a team of actors presenting a convincing and compellingly chilling tale of survival that's well crafted by those behind the camera too.",
            "A decent premise with a passable execution. The film seems like it portrays events relatively faithfully but in doing so perhaps neglects narrative drive or meaningful plot development. I think the film would have been a lot tighter if 15-25 minutes of waiting in the snow was skipped over more briefly. The length of time they were trapped was of course a huge part of their miraculous story but i don't think the film did a great job of portraying that on screen. I kept wondering \"why doesn't someone go seeking help when they know no one is looking for them?\" and i don't think the film adequately addressed that question either in action or dialogue. Character development was negligible with the film noticeably dragging through the middle portion without a compelling reason. Not a film i'll likely remember nor one i'd recommend seeing."

            "Django, you drag your coffin around, coffin around, coffin around. \r\n\r\nDjango is directed by Sergio Corbucci and it stars Franco Nero, Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo, Loredana Nusciak, \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez and Eduardo Fajardo. \r\n\r\nDjango (Nero), dragging a coffin behind him, saves a woman from some bandits and soon finds himself in the middle of war between two factions - which he may be able to use to his advantage. \r\n\r\n1966 was a stellar year for Spaghetti Westerns, Leone was putting the crown on his \"Dollars\" trilogy, Damiani produced a political firecracker and Sollima crafted one of the finest \"manhunt\" Oaters of this sub-genre. Then there is this, Django, a Pasta Western that is synonymous with the form. \r\n\r\nI fought for the North! \r\n\r\nDjango is a treat, it's violent and cruel, funny and cheeky, and pleasing on the eyes and ears - so pretty much it contains all the best things that made the original wave of Spaghetti's so palatable. Undeniably it owes a \"lot\" to A Fistful of Dollars and Yojimbo, but it's still its own beast, a baroque Gothic piece of work that positively revels in nihilism. The graphic violence is wonderfully cartoonish, the iconography unbound, and in Nero - eyes likes chips of ice - the pic has one of the coolest and baddest men on the planet. Nusciak brings the sex and sizzle, coming off like a Spag Raquel Welch, whilst the villains are delightfully vile and scuzzy. \r\n\r\nThe setting is superb, a muddy cold hell of a town with a brothel as the fulcrum of the piece. Naturally there's a cemetery, which will play host to some of that iconography mentioned earlier. Religion gets short shrift, racial prejudice given a caustic once over, while it's worth mentioning there's more than a hint of social realism pulsing away as Corbucci brings the blood and thunder. OK! It's light in plotting, and it's not even Corbucci's best film, but the stylised violence, the visuals and a cracking soundtrack easily take you away from the fodder of the story. \r\n\r\nIt would spawn a multitude of rip-offs, name checks and influence a whole host of film makers, but this is the real deal. A Spag Western worth revisiting to see just when it was a sub-genre of quality, this before hundreds of poor band wagon jumpers began to soil the Spaghetti Western name. 8.5/10",
            "***Cult Spaghetti Western with Django dragging his coffin***\r\n\r\nA mysterious stranger dragging a coffin (Franco Nero) saves a prostitute named Maria (Loredana Nusciak) and waltzes into a neutral border town that services both a private militia of ex-Rebels led by Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and a small army of Mexican revolutionaries, led by General Hugo (Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo). Meanwhile there\u2019s gold to be had.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1966, \u201cDjango\u201d (pronounced JANG-oh) is a cult Euro Western highlighted by its star and the typical cartoonish flourishes of the genre. Franco Nero and his Spaghetti Western lookalike, Terence Hill, represented the Euro-version of Clint Eastwood. To be expected, the characters are cardboard caricatures and there\u2019s a lot of brutal violence that\u2019s so sadistic and overdone it\u2019s comical.\r\n\r\nFor instance, 15 men are dead by the 20 minute mark with 40 more shortly later in a machine gun bloodbath. A mere half hour later there\u2019s a second machine gun assault lacking any artistic finesse whatsoever. It has to be seen to be believed and bespeaks of moviemaking for 13 year-olds. \r\n\r\nConsidering what\u2019s in Django\u2019s coffin, the way he drags it around isn\u2019t practical for more than 100 yards. The manner he awkwardly slogs it about is especially incredulous during the gold theft sequence where, curiously, no one sees or hears him. _Why Sure!_        \r\n\r\nWhen do these events take place? The death date on Mercedes Zaro\u2019s tombstone says 1889, which is substantiated by the use of the standard lever-action rifles and Django\u2019s quasi-Maxim machine gun, pointing to no earlier than 1884.\r\n\r\nTarantino took elements of \u201cDjango\u201d and other Spag Westerns to forge the outstanding \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), which makes \u201cDjango\u201d & most Euro Westerns of the 60s and early 70s pale by comparison. The title song by Luis Bacalov is good though and Nusciak is striking in an icy way.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes (with censored versions running 3-4 minutes less) and was shot in Madrid, Spain, and Lazio, Italy.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C",
            "\u201cDjango, have you always been alone?\u201d The song, written by Luis Bacalov and performed by Rocky Roberts, ponders, as an unknown man drags a coffin through the mud. That man is Django, a gunslinger who would go on to define a genre, and the protagonist of a gritty, violent and outrageously fun film. A man to respect, that is for sure.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by Sergio Corbucci, the same artist responsible for classics such as Navajo Joe (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), the film is one of the most influential Spaghetti Westerns ever. It tells the story of Django (Franco Nero), a tragic hero with a mysterious background, who arrives at a town in war. Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and his men try to exterminate the Mexicans, who, led by General Rodriguez (Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo) are trying to set up their revolution. In between the two sides is Nathaniel (\u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez), the owner of the bar, hotel and bordello, who has to serve both sides.\r\n\t\r\nA career-launching - and defining - performance by Franco Nero is one of the elements that make this flick a success. His character is defined by a constant feel of melancholy, to which Nero brings gravitas: while never losing his cool, especially through his steely and confident stares, Django is clearly portrayed as a haunted man. The supporting cast goes a long way in cementing the heavy tone of the film, especially Loredana Nusciak, giving a gutsy performance as a prostitute who falls for the titular character.\r\n\t\r\nA notable part of this film\u2019s magic are the action sequences. While extremely brutal for their time, including a man\u2019s ear getting quite graphically severed, they are the absolute definition of \u201ccampy\u201d. Instead of ruining it, it only makes the experience more enjoyable. The violence essentially gets a more humorous vibe, serving even as a relief from all the graveness that is present everywhere else in the movie.\r\n\t\r\nThe soundtrack is remarkable: not only does it present an unforgettable theme song for the opening, but it also has a spectacular use of the leitmotif (a recurring musical phrase).\r\n\t\r\nDjango is, in every possible way, a classic and standard bearer of its genre. Even with campy violent sequences for the public\u2019s enjoyment, the film still maintains a serious storyline, and has great dramatic performances - especially by the central actor. As an answer to the question asked in the song, after gaining a huge legion of fans, it\u2019s safe to say Django will no longer be alone.",
            "Entertaining enough spaghetti western that isn't quite to the level of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly but still liked it quite a bit, including Franco Nero in the lead. Kind of blew its load early on with the machine gun massacre (would've liked the reveal of what was in the coffin at the end), but had a nice conclusion. **3.75/5**",
            "Like many films of this time/genre you have to be prepared to accept the dodgy dubbing and also, in the case of \"Django\", some particularly ropey singing by Rocky Roberts in order to give it a chance. If you do that, then you will find it moves along well with lots of shoot 'em ups - a Gattling Gun with an inexhaustible supply of bullets being pre-eminent; glamorous, but totally helpless women and an evil, brooding baddie who has virtually no lines to speak. Oh, and there is a coffin too. Franco Nero - and his legendary blue eyes - delivers his best performance in this Corbucci gem of a film."

Then there is this, Django, a Pasta Western that is synonymous with the form. \r\n\r\nI fought for the North! \r\n\r\nDjango is a treat, it's violent and cruel, funny and cheeky, and pleasing on the eyes and ears - so pretty much it contains all the best things that made the original wave of Spaghetti's so palatable. Undeniably it owes a \"lot\" to A Fistful of Dollars and Yojimbo, but it's still its own beast, a baroque Gothic piece of work that positively revels in nihilism. The graphic violence is wonderfully cartoonish, the iconography unbound, and in Nero - eyes likes chips of ice - the pic has one of the coolest and baddest men on the planet. Nusciak brings the sex and sizzle, coming off like a Spag Raquel Welch, whilst the villains are delightfully vile and scuzzy. \r\n\r\nThe setting is superb, a muddy cold hell of a town with a brothel as the fulcrum of the piece. Naturally there's a cemetery, which will play host to some of that iconography mentioned earlier. Religion gets short shrift, racial prejudice given a caustic once over, while it's worth mentioning there's more than a hint of social realism pulsing away as Corbucci brings the blood and thunder. OK! It's light in plotting, and it's not even Corbucci's best film, but the stylised violence, the visuals and a cracking soundtrack easily take you away from the fodder of the story. \r\n\r\nIt would spawn a multitude of rip-offs, name checks and influence a whole host of film makers, but this is the real deal. A Spag Western worth revisiting to see just when it was a sub-genre of quality, this before hundreds of poor band wagon jumpers began to soil the Spaghetti Western name. 8.5/10",
            "***Cult Spaghetti Western with Django dragging his coffin***\r\n\r\nA mysterious stranger dragging a coffin (Franco Nero) saves a prostitute named Maria (Loredana Nusciak) and waltzes into a neutral border town that services both a private militia of ex-Rebels led by Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and a small army of Mexican revolutionaries, led by General Hugo (Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo). Meanwhile there\u2019s gold to be had.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1966, \u201cDjango\u201d (pronounced JANG-oh) is a cult Euro Western highlighted by its star and the typical cartoonish flourishes of the genre. Franco Nero and his Spaghetti Western lookalike, Terence Hill, represented the Euro-version of Clint Eastwood. To be expected, the characters are cardboard caricatures and there\u2019s a lot of brutal violence that\u2019s so sadistic and overdone it\u2019s comical.\r\n\r\nFor instance, 15 men are dead by the 20 minute mark with 40 more shortly later in a machine gun bloodbath. A mere half hour later there\u2019s a second machine gun assault lacking any artistic finesse whatsoever. It has to be seen to be believed and bespeaks of moviemaking for 13 year-olds. \r\n\r\nConsidering what\u2019s in Django\u2019s coffin, the way he drags it around isn\u2019t practical for more than 100 yards. The manner he awkwardly slogs it about is especially incredulous during the gold theft sequence where, curiously, no one sees or hears him. _Why Sure!_        \r\n\r\nWhen do these events take place? The death date on Mercedes Zaro\u2019s tombstone says 1889, which is substantiated by the use of the standard lever-action rifles and Django\u2019s quasi-Maxim machine gun, pointing to no earlier than 1884.\r\n\r\nTarantino took elements of \u201cDjango\u201d and other Spag Westerns to forge the outstanding \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), which makes \u201cDjango\u201d & most Euro Westerns of the 60s and early 70s pale by comparison. The title song by Luis Bacalov is good though and Nusciak is striking in an icy way.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes (with censored versions running 3-4 minutes less) and was shot in Madrid, Spain, and Lazio, Italy.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C",
            "\u201cDjango, have you always been alone?\u201d The song, written by Luis Bacalov and performed by Rocky Roberts, ponders, as an unknown man drags a coffin through the mud. That man is Django, a gunslinger who would go on to define a genre, and the protagonist of a gritty, violent and outrageously fun film. A man to respect, that is for sure.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by Sergio Corbucci, the same artist responsible for classics such as Navajo Joe (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), the film is one of the most influential Spaghetti Westerns ever. It tells the story of Django (Franco Nero), a tragic hero with a mysterious background, who arrives at a town in war. Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and his men try to exterminate the Mexicans, who, led by General Rodriguez (Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo) are trying to set up their revolution. In between the two sides is Nathaniel (\u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez), the owner of the bar, hotel and bordello, who has to serve both sides.\r\n\t\r\nA career-launching - and defining - performance by Franco Nero is one of the elements that make this flick a success. His character is defined by a constant feel of melancholy, to which Nero brings gravitas: while never losing his cool, especially through his steely and confident stares, Django is clearly portrayed as a haunted man. The supporting cast goes a long way in cementing the heavy tone of the film, especially Loredana Nusciak, giving a gutsy performance as a prostitute who falls for the titular character.\r\n\t\r\nA notable part of this film\u2019s magic are the action sequences. While extremely brutal for their time, including a man\u2019s ear getting quite graphically severed, they are the absolute definition of \u201ccampy\u201d. Instead of ruining it, it only makes the experience more enjoyable. The violence essentially gets a more humorous vibe, serving even as a relief from all the graveness that is present everywhere else in the movie.\r\n\t\r\nThe soundtrack is remarkable: not only does it present an unforgettable theme song for the opening, but it also has a spectacular use of the leitmotif (a recurring musical phrase).\r\n\t\r\nDjango is, in every possible way, a classic and standard bearer of its genre. Even with campy violent sequences for the public\u2019s enjoyment, the film still maintains a serious storyline, and has great dramatic performances - especially by the central actor. As an answer to the question asked in the song, after gaining a huge legion of fans, it\u2019s safe to say Django will no longer be alone.",
            "Entertaining enough spaghetti western that isn't quite to the level of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly but still liked it quite a bit, including Franco Nero in the lead. Kind of blew its load early on with the machine gun massacre (would've liked the reveal of what was in the coffin at the end), but had a nice conclusion. **3.75/5**",
            "Like many films of this time/genre you have to be prepared to accept the dodgy dubbing and also, in the case of \"Django\", some particularly ropey singing by Rocky Roberts in order to give it a chance. If you do that, then you will find it moves along well with lots of shoot 'em ups - a Gattling Gun with an inexhaustible supply of bullets being pre-eminent; glamorous, but totally helpless women and an evil, brooding baddie who has virtually no lines to speak. Oh, and there is a coffin too. Franco Nero - and his legendary blue eyes - delivers his best performance in this Corbucci gem of a film."

            "Oh my God the time traveler in this movie is an idiot! Do as the time machine guys says and DON'T GO ANYWHERE FOR ONE HOUR. But nope, he's gotta go meddle with the timeline and create multiple versions of himself and events. \r\n\r\nI'm a sucker for time travel flicks, and for a very low budget Spanish import, it was fairly entertaining, but check out the much better \"Predestination\" instead if you haven't seen it. ",
            "Timecrimes (2007), titled initially Los cronocr\u00edmenes, is one of the best time-travel movies available. Written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, it was made in Spain and performed in Spanish. Reading English subtitles will not distract, however, as much of the movie is visual, and the pacing is not slow but methodical. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Hector and starts at his house, which he recently moved into. He sees something in the woods behind his house and goes to investigate. He is stabbed, and while running away from the mysterious masked figure, he enters a secret lab in the neighboring field. While hiding from the masked figure, he is transported back in time one hour and makes some amazing discoveries about himself. What must he do, and what is he willing to do, to restore the life he had before his accidental time-traveling adventure?\r\n\r\nThe story illustrates the complexities of time-travel and what having multiple \"you\"-beings in existence at once can lead to. Very entertaining and a definite \"much watch.\"",
            "Before I say a word about the movie itself, let me advise you that if you haven\u2019t already seen the preview for this movie, do yourself a favor and Don\u2019t Watch It! Never have I known a preview to give so much away, and it it is particularly heinous in this case as it is a time travel movie, with plot shifts that should be experienced in real time, so to speak. I would have been some old mad if I had watched the preview first.\r\n\r\nBut on to the movie itself. This is a Spanish language movie with subtitles, but that didn\u2019t detract from my enjoyment of it. It is nicely set up and cleverly done. At one point I guessed right about a little plot twist I saw coming, but there was much more I didn\u2019t predict, which brings us back to how glad I am I didn\u2019t watch that preview. I expect this was a low budget film and there aren\u2019t many characters in it, so don\u2019t expect a glitzy production with awesome special effects. It just tells the story. I did feel like Hector made a couple of really stupid decisions along the way, but I cut it some slack because without them we have a boring half-hour movie!\r\n\r\nOkay, I will stop talking about what happens so as not to possibly give anything away. If you like time travel stories as I do, and are intrigued by the anomalies and problems such fictional activity can cause, give this movie a try.",
            "Timecrimes is a simple yet clever sci-fi thriller that makes the most of its small-scale production. Most of the movie takes place in just three locations\u2014the house, the woods, and the lab with the time machine\u2014but it never feels limited. Instead, the confined setting adds to the intensity and focus of the story.\r\n\r\nThe acting was solid. It wasn\u2019t flashy or overly dramatic, but it felt natural and believable, which kept me invested. The plot is straightforward enough to follow, but it still manages to surprise you. It\u2019s one of those movies where everything clicks into place by the time it wraps up, making the rewatchability high.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed it. Timecrimes proves you don\u2019t need a big budget or flashy effects to deliver a compelling and fun story. It\u2019s smart, engaging, and worth a watch if you like time-travel twists.",
            "\u201cHector\u201d (Karra Elejalde) is sitting idly in his new garden looking through his binoculars when he espies something odd in the woods. At a glance, it looks like something with great red eyes! Then, almost immediately, he thinks he sees a naked woman. This has to be investigated so off he goes, only to arrive and discover a body and to be stabbed by a mysterious man whose face is covered in blood-stained bandages. Who is this character? Well the scissor-wielding felon quickly heads to a remote lab in the woods where we meet \u201cEl Joven\u201d (Nacho Vigalondo) who seems to have managed to concoct some sort of time-travelling machine and there is more than one \u201cHector\u201d now doing the rounds! The young scientist is at his wits end as to what to do whilst the latest iteration of \u201cHector\u201d has decided he wants to dispose of the others and use the young girl whose body started the whole thing in the first place (B\u00e1rbara Goenaga) as a lure. It\u2019s one of those lightly comedic dramas, this, that reminded me of a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d series from the 1980s coupled with some quirky characters and a little naughty voyeurism! Elejalde holds it together quite entertainingly even if there are quite a few plot holes liberally sprinkled throughout - just how this all got started in the first place, for example - and it\u2019s still quite a good fun watch that could almost be be set as a silent film to maximise the daftness of the repetitive but never quite identical scenarios as they play out. Indeed, it\u2019s quite possible that each version of \u201cHector\u201d suffers from some sort of brain-drain each time, as he definitely gets more and more dopey. It packs quite a bit into ninety minutes given it can\u2019t have had much of a budget, so if you like your sci-fi devoid of flashy visuals and whizzy audio then you might just enjoy this. I did."

            "**The night of the battle of the hackers!**\r\n\r\nI have been longing to watch this film since it was out, only now it had happened. There are not many hacking film that could satisfy thoroughly. Well, I haven't found as impressive as the recent 'Who Am I'. This film was more like partially a found-footage type. Everything was from webcams and phone cams. Not exactly truthful to the reality. Even people with basic knowledge about computers would know that. But entertainment was there. I enjoyed it, mainly because of the speed and being an edgy.\r\n\r\nWell, a contest winner is waiting in his hotel room for his dinner date with a celebrity in the later night. While he was updating his blog, someone hacks his computer and gives more contents for the blog than he had thought of. But soon it all plays out differently. Now he's the hacker's puppet, and must follow everything he says or the consequences would be serious. How far it all goes and how it all ends are the remaining story to tell us.\r\n\r\nAs I said not the best in this theme, but watchable film. Everything was a one night event. Slowly started and then picked up the pace before ending on a high. The end was not good, the twist. At least that's how I felt. Should have been better, yet acceptable. Elijah was good. I just checked it out after seeing his nice act in his latest Netflix film. The rest of the cast was fine too. A Spanish film in English language. Soon I'm going to check out the 'Colossal' from this same director. So it is a good time pass film and you might enjoy it as I did.\r\n\r\n**6/10**",

I give credit to Vigalondo for the incredible skills it would take to conceive this story and put the film together, but it\u2019s annoyingly complex with some \u201cWhy sure!\u201d plot turns.

            "_Sisu_ is an hour and a half slaughter fest loaded with despicable characters that you will actually enjoy seeing being ripped to pieces.\r\n\r\nIt is a film that endorses its simplicity a bit too heavily, but is an otherwise immensely entertaining piece of popcorn entertainment that will satisfy action junkies.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/05/10/sisu-review-buying-the-golden-farm/",
            "\r\n\r\nSisu is a Finnish film, not from Quentin Tarantino but certainly cut from the same variety of gruesome cloth. The film is visceral and over the top, celebrating slaughter, in a variety of horrifically novel, ways. \r\n\r\nI personally found the whole affair gratuitous, to be honest. What dwelt at the back of my mind and I feel should be remembered, is war is not a joke or a carnival. \r\n\r\nI grew up surrounded by people who lived and in some cases, served during WWII. The few tales they told were sad, often tragic and spoke of people trapped into a reality, not of their making or their wanting.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, Sisu is well paced, exposition driven and has lots of variety in its action. Acting is solid but exposition, is really this flicks, true driver. On a certain level too, this film, recalls spaghetti Westerns, with a WWII, make over. \r\n\r\nIn summary, if you like splatter style films, you'll probably like this, Just keep in mind, real people lived and died in WWII, on both sides. War is not a game, its not an entertainment.",
            "The movie is all action but without special computer effects (at least none that are over the top like almost all Hollywood movies in last decade). It's all killing and blood with some unrealistic scenes but still a lot better than Hollywood stuff of last decade. No woke stuff here. Definitely worth watching for hour and a half of entertainment without political or social propaganda.",
            "I did quite enjoy this, but you really do have to be prepared to leave your common sense at the door. It's all about a man \"Aatami\" (Jorma Tommila) who having had a brutal WWII already, has taken refuge in the remote Finnish wilderness where he is panning for - and finds - gold. Packing up, he sets off for civilisation but en route, encounters a dishevelled Nazi tank patrol under the command of \"Bruno\" (Aksel Hennie). Initially, they have little interest in the pilgrim, but some gunfire and explosions shortly after he passes them piques their interest and soon the most perilous of manhunts is engaged. The \"Sisu\" myth is based around a person who is not immortal, but who simply refuses to die - and \"Aatami\" certainly fits the bill. He flirts with knives, bullets, landmines and even the noose but death clearly doesn't want him just yet! Can he get his gold to the bank? It is gory, this film, but I found in quite a light-hearted way. Limbs blown hither and tither but somehow not in a menacing, or scary, fashion. Indeed, at times the action is actually mildly entertaining - especially when the women prisoners are given the opportunity for some good old-fashioned revenge. It's told with an hybrid Guy Ritchie or Sergio Leone style, episodically, and for the first hour works quite well. The tail end, though, falls away as the film - always of questionable plausibility - becomes just a little bit too \"A-Team\". There isn't much dialogue to comment on - no bad thing; and the action comes thick and fast in a production that is wonderfully illustrative of the bleakness of this environment (and of some with an human soul).",
            "There\u2019s a great deal of pleasure to be had in watching one man violently dispatch dozens of evil Nazis, and the WWII action film \u201cSisu\u201d is a brutal, bloody delight. This midnight movie from writer-director Jalmari Helander embraces a comic book mentality that\u2019s balanced with gory kills, a hearty dose of wit, and a potent story about courage and determination.\r\n\r\nWith the second world war coming to an end, a solitary prospector (Jorma Tommila) in the Lapland wilderness of Northern Finland searches for gold with his last remaining companion: his dog. The pair cross paths with a band of Nazis who have left a path of scorched-earth destruction in their wake. Seeing an easy target, the Nazis steal the man\u2019s large bag of gold. What they didn\u2019t bargain for is that the man they\u2019ve pissed off is no ordinary miner. The prospector is an ex-commando who is the stuff of legends, and he becomes a one-man death squad who will do anything to get his gold back. Unfortunately for the thieves, this means killing every single Nazi that comes into sight.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s title comes from the Finnish concept of \u201csisu,\u201d a white-knuckled form of courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. It\u2019s a kick-ass idea to build a story upon, and Helander creates a myth that seems both outrageous yet plausible. The film is divided into chapters, each adding another level of depth to the narrative (including an unexpected and rousing piece that celebrates female empowerment). Viewers looking for nonstop action may find the film to be slow in parts, but the character development is well done (in reality, the pacing is almost perfect).\r\n\r\nHelander understands the real reason you\u2019re here, though: to watch a good old fashioned Nazi massacre. Once the violence starts, it does not disappoint. There are shootings, stabbings, hangings, immolations, and all manners of complete annihilation. Body parts fly, men are crushed by tanks, and a horse explodes, just to name a few. As the kills pile up, the cheers for the body count of dead Nazis grow louder.\r\n\r\n\u201cSisu\u201d is a skillfully crafted action film that\u2019s a ton of fun. There\u2019s plenty of bloody killing, but also an absorbing dramatic arc that quietly builds into a deafening crescendo.",
            "This is gourmet action food. If you think Marvel heroes are great, they pale compared to this guy. Or, if you just like watching Nazis get the living shit beat out of them, (I know I do) this is the film to watch. Or maybe you just want to see raped women get empowered for revenge. Sisu has all that. And it's bloody.\r\n\r\nI also love words that have no direct translation to English, like the Portuguese word soldade, or the German Schadenfreude. Now I've learned another, the Finnish word Sisu: A white-knuckled courage and unimaginable determination.",
            "WWII action thriller about a lone man and ex-military that mines gold in Lapland, Finland during 1944 and the retreat of nazis forces. After encountering an abundant quantity of gold he encounters retreating units of nazis, a bigger one that encounters him, and a little one that messes with him and hell is set loose.\r\n\r\nJalmari Helander director and writer did a good job on this one, that is divided in chapters - similarities with Rambo III and John Wick aren't so coincide since the production crew worked in John Wick.\r\n\r\nWait for gory deaths, and very good choreographies on the sequences of fighting. The story is also original in it's way and reminds a lot Tarantino.\r\n\r\nJorma Tommila as Aatami the protagonist does a good job, better that Keanu btw. There are some goofs as the post WWII tank used by the germans but ok.\r\n\r\nGood production and fun if you like revenge and violent movies, a 7,0 out of 10,0 / B for me.",
            "Sisu is an utterly ridiculous film.\r\n\r\nIf Aatami was a woman, at least one \"reviewer\" here would be wailing about how woke this movie is, because it's only acceptable escapism if it's a man surviving a tank assault, a flurry of bullets, mines, immolation, drowning, hanging, and a goddamn plane crash.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Sisu was indeed, quite an entertaining movie.",
            "It's a combination of John Wick  and Mad Max Fury Road wrapped up in one badass Finn.  Excellent action movie. \r\n\r\nGood way to start off 2025, killing a bunch of Nazis."

            "This is a very good action/thriller flick. It currently holds a 7.9 rating at IMDb which it certainly deserves. The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).\r\n\r\nI generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real badass, I-kick-the-shit-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.\r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.\r\n\r\nThis is really a textbook action/thriller movie. A very enjoyable hour and a half indeed.",
            "Daddy knows best \u2014 especially when it comes to a mostly untrustworthy cast of Europeans \u2014\u00a0in this action film. Liam Neeson's performance elevated this from being forgettable. Otherwise, I kind of didn't care.",
            "Probably not good enough to have started the Revenge-Renaissance that it somehow did, but still a pretty entertaining time. _Taken_ does hit a lot of clich\u00e9s though, and I mean, it starts hitting them right away. We're literally only minutes into the film before we find out that Neeson's lead character is divorced, and his wife has re-married to a decent, rich provider, but one who's bookish and could never take him in a fight, and that the present he got for his daughter is for an interest that she no longer has. But once we get into the action proper, it's pretty great.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "Random viewing tonight, just wanted a slick and simple action-thriller and this fit the bill. Liam Neeson kicks ass and can see why his career in this genre really took off. The camera work was probably the biggest drawback (shaky cam), likely trying emulate the Bourne franchise or something. But entertaining flick that doesn't overstay its welcome coming in at around 90-minutes. **4.0/5**",
            "Your arrogance offends me.\r\n\r\nIt is proof positive that you can still have a basic and formulaic genre piece and the multiplex crowd will forgive it the sins of film making. For here we have a revenge thriller that is over reliant on a ream of contrivances? The kind that people scoff at when horror pictures not wanting to be serious get screamed down for?. There is also some pretty poor acting performances on show, the usually reliable Famke Jansen looks lost when asked to show emotion, Maggie Grace needs to go back to acting school, whilst some of the French actors on show give French actors a bad name.\r\n\r\nHowever the true saving grace in the movie, outside of some serious revenge fuelled torture sequences, is Liam Neeson in the lead role of Bryan Mills. Charismatic and believable as a father hell bent on finding the one thing worthwhile that he has in his life, it's only here that Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen's uneven writing gets any sort of urgency to go with the tidily put together action sequences. Taken is an enjoyable film if taken within the context of its genre, and for sure the subject matter of skin trafficking is a noteworthy plot, but no one can surely deny it doesn't have a shallow core and honestly isn't giving anything new to a pretty stagnated formula... \r\n\r\nBy the by, the thrills ensure popcorn pleasing pleasures and thus it's rated as such. 7/10",
            "**You will find this movie. You will watch it.**\r\n\r\nThis movie came out of nowhere! The trailer for this film relied on just one short scene of Liam Neeson threatening a kidnapper on the phone... and that was all we needed to be hooked! A basic revenge/rescue movie elevated by fantastic action, stunt directing, and Liam Neeson's delivery, all transporting this thriller into a believable reality. One of the best of the genre that paved the way for John Wick.",
            "Taken is one of those action thrillers that doesn\u2019t waste time getting to the point. The plot is straightforward but gripping, setting up just enough character development before throwing you into a tense, fast-paced ride. It plays on a real-world issue in a way that feels urgent, making you root for the protagonist as he fights against an unrelenting system. While the villains aren\u2019t particularly deep, the generalization works in the movie\u2019s favor, highlighting the unsettling reality of indifference toward human trafficking. The story keeps things simple but effective, balancing emotional stakes with action that never slows down.\r\n\r\nThe direction by Pierre Morel is sharp and efficient, keeping the pacing tight and the tension high. The cinematography leans into a gritty, realistic style that enhances the intensity, with some great handheld shots that put you right in the middle of the action. Fight sequences are well-executed, focusing on clean, brutal choreography instead of flashy, over-the-top stunts. It feels raw and believable, making every punch and takedown hit harder. The script, while not overly complex, delivers exactly what\u2019s needed, with dialogue that is to the point and a few memorable lines that have stuck with audiences for years.\r\n\r\nLiam Neeson carries the film effortlessly, giving a performance that is both emotionally grounded and intimidating. He turns what could have been a standard action role into something much more compelling, making you feel every ounce of desperation and determination in his character. The supporting cast does their job well, though some characters don\u2019t get much depth, which is expected given the movie\u2019s runtime. The score complements the film\u2019s tone, keeping the tension high and the momentum going without being distracting. Overall, Taken is a lean, intense action thriller that doesn\u2019t try to be anything more than what it is, and that\u2019s exactly why it works so well."

            "\"Rita\" (Zoe Saldana) is a lawyer in Mexico who finds her professionalism attracting the attention of the powerful drug lord \"Manitas\". He spends his time heavily guarded and constantly on the move as he pretty much controls the synthetic drug trade in and out of his country. What does he want with \"Rita\" though? Well tempted by a great deal of money, she makes the perilous trip to meet him and find out. Suffice to say she gets quite a shock when she discovers that he is determined to become a woman. \"Rita\" is now charged with the ultra-discrete task of finding a surgeon who can turn \"Manitas\" into \"Emilia\". Not only is this highly dangerous for the lawyer, but it's also no walk in the park for the gangster or his family who will need to be relocated and convinced that dad is no more. What now ensues tests the mettle of both characters, especially as the erstwhile father struggles rather more than he'd anticipated when it comes to losing his wife \"Jessi\" (Selena Gomez) and his two young children. Can he stay out of their lives for ever or might he succumb to that temptation and set the cat amongst the familial pigeons? The story is a bit too episodic and the characterisations superficial at times, which is a shame. That said, though, there is still a strong and emotionally powerful effort from Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n as the ruthlessly violent killer who undergoes more than a physical transformation over the four or five year period this drama covers. Saldana also holds this together well delivering an engaging performance as a character who has perhaps lost faith in what the system can do to make things better for ordinary people, so adopts a more \"inside the tent of the enemy\" approach. It's peppered with musical numbers. Some of those work better than others at introducing delicacy, love, lust and anger into the proceedings but let's be under no illusions that there are any great singers here. I found the denouement a bit rushed and frankly rather weak, but the whole film does shine rather a provocative light on attitudes to gender identification and just as importantly to corruption and the relatively minimal value placed on human life in country where someone almost always works for someone else. It's just a little over two hours, but once it gets into gear it doesn't hang around making for a decent watch tackling important topics that's worth a gander.",
            "It generally takes tremendous courage to stand up and proclaim that the Emperor is indeed naked, especially in the face of a crowd of willfully blind onlookers who contend otherwise. Nevertheless, there are times when this truly needs to be said in light of an inexplicably misguided view to the contrary. And that\u2019s certainly the case with the latest from often-overrated writer-director Jacques Audiard. This jumbled mess of a film can\u2019t make up its mind if it wants to be an edgy musical (given its forgettable songs and original score), a quasi-campy comedy (despite its palpable lack of bona fide humor but with a narrative that\u2019s admittedly frequently laughable), a crime thriller (one that feebly grows ever more pretentious, meandering, implausible and uncompelling with each passing frame) or a treatise on forgiveness and redemption that unapologetically drips with overwrought political correctness. In essence, this offering follows the exploits of Manitas (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n), a Mexican drug cartel warlord who wants to undergo the transgender transition process to liberate the inner woman that has been inside him since birth, aided by a supposedly articulate and self-righteous lawyer (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) who hastily and seemingly thoughtlessly sells out with the promise of a financial windfall for her assistance. After undergoing the process, however, the newly emerged Emilia P\u00e9rez has regrets about her past, both in terms of her brutal \u201cprofessional\u201d behavior and the abandonment of her kids and shrewish, self-centered wife (a fine performance by Selena Gomez in one of the film\u2019s few praiseworthy assets). However, this change of heart, while modestly understandable, generally lacks believability. And, given the utterly reprehensible nature and baffling, head-scratchingly contradictory choices of all the principals, it\u2019s difficult to fathom how anyone would care a whit about any of them. That\u2019s especially true for the picture\u2019s lead, whose actions do little to generate any kind of meaningful empathy for transgender individuals and causes. And, through it all, the story is mystifyingly augmented with a slew of inconsistently timed, largely unremarkable musical production numbers that add precious little to the overall story (they could have been left out entirely and it would likely have made for a more compelling release). In sum, the finished product plays like a preposterously melodramatic Italian opera libretto mixed with elements from pictures like \u201cSicario\u201d (2015) and any number of cheesy Mexican soap operas. How this cinematic morass has managed to garner as much attention as it has received is truly beyond me. That\u2019s especially true with the many undeserved accolades it has received, including 10 Golden Globe Award nominations (a virtually unheard-of number for any film in this awards competition), as well as honors from the Critics Choice Awards, the American Film Institute, and numerous film festivals, including the prestigious events in Cannes and Toronto. Indeed, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that the blend of diverse elements here should be taken for inventive, inspired originality. But, more importantly, don\u2019t waste your time on this celluloid trash, despite how allegedly elegant the Emperor\u2019s outfits are said to be.",
            "Is _Emilia P\u00e9rez_ the riskiest movie in years?\r\n\r\nA Spanish-language musical from a French director, about gendered violence and corruption, starring a transgender actress as a Mexican cartel boss who abandons his family, vanishes into hiding and transitions to become a woman.\r\n\r\nIt's A LOT. And yes, the film has drawn some criticism. But it\u2019s obvious that the soul of _Emilia P\u00e9rez_ beats with the daring of a curious artist who prizes emotional authenticity above all else.\r\n\r\nCould you give up your own family to live as your true self? How much can a person change at their core? Does the 'wolf' remain a wolf? While director Jacques Audiard doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers, what\u2019s clear is the film's unquestionable passion. _Emilia P\u00e9rez_ is a pure force; designed to grab us by the hearts and minds and wow us.\r\n\r\nRead our full take on _Emilia P\u00e9rez_ at good.film: https://good.film/guide/why-emilia-perez-is-the-riskiest-movie-youve-seen-in-years",
            "How is it a white Irish-American can speak better Spanish than the Spanish speakers in this train wreck?\r\n\r\nAnd.... a musical with \"penis\" and \"vagina\" as the lyrics as it pushes gender transitions?\r\n\r\nWhat we have is an insult to Spanish speakers, an insult that pushes the Latinx concept that most Latino's reject, and then pushes the they/them that lost Kamala the race... so of course it has 13 Academy Award nominations.\r\n\r\nBut the nominations don't mean it's any good.  It's crap, it's a really bad movie and I feel horrible for the native Spanish speakers that this movie mocks and belittles.  \r\n\r\nBut of course it's going to get a boatload of nominations, it's woke AF.  So woke, it's another box office bomb.",
            "<em>'Emilia P\u00e9rez'</em> is a film that I feel like shouldn't work, yet I did actually have a positive two hours+ viewing it. The musical pieces do take some getting used to and I'm not entirely convinced by most of them, but again somehow it didn't overly bother me whilst watching.\r\n\r\nThere's no doubt, for me, that the greatest part of this is Zoe Salda\u00f1a. I've seen her in many roles before and I love her in those, especially <em>'Avatar'</em> and even in a tiny <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em> role, but I'd say this is her best performance from the 11 movies that I've seen from her. Outstanding!\r\n\r\nI also enjoyed those behind Salda\u00f1a, namely Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Selena Gomez; I watched the latter in 2012's <em>'Spring Breakers'</em> a few weeks back, her acting has improved impressively. I do think if the cast weren't as strong as they are, I may have liked this much less.\r\n\r\nI'm only now seeing all the furore about this film, that Wikipedia article makes for quite the reading - what a mess! This is why I like switching off the noise, even if it does make me feel like that meme where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbzerIOUR8A\" rel=\"nofollow\">that guy calmly eats his food while a brawl breaks out around him</a>."

            "There is no excuse for basing a screenplay on taking seriously a well known urban myth and writing it as if the audience believes the myth.\r\n\r\nDid no one up the entire production line step out and call bullshit on the discredited 'we only use 10% of our brain,' idea? I am so embarrassed by seeing actors I admire, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman, deliver solid performances on the basis of an idea at which most people laugh.",
            "I've also struggled to appreciate several o Luc Besson's movies but this is is by far the worst one.\r\n\r\nA lot of jibber-jabber bullshit with sexy Scarlett Johansson, lots of FX, predictable ending in Paris and a pointless car race on its streets.\r\n\r\nBetter spend your time on something else ...",
            "Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge.\r\n\r\nLucy is one of those films that brings about furious reactions, it is after all a science fiction type action thriller. They always divide film fans right from the off. It's a film that to all intents and purposes needs to be viewed just as a cinematic experience, as a piece of popcorn fodder that may try to be something more cerebral, but ultimately is a daft - but hugely fun - piece of film.\r\n\r\nLuc Besson writes and directs a film that sees Scarlett Johansson duped into being a drug mule, with the transportation of drugs sewn into her abdomen. It's a new drug, boy is it a new drug, and when things go belly up and the drugs are unleashed into Scarlett's system, she's a threat - or hope - to mankind.\r\n\r\nIt can be, and has been, called pretentious et al, such is the science factor, which is perfectly understandable, so any hope of tight science fiction musings will only end up in a crushing disappointment. Undeniably Besson and his backers thought they had something to say, to open up the film watchers' minds to something deep and probable, to be relevant and viable. But unlike the makers we the viewers didn't have access to donepezil, so we sadly couldn't all turn into Bradley Cooper and be limitless in our viewing capabilities.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it's a rollicking fun film for two thirds, when it's about Scarlett kicking butt, a revenge driven babe, it grips and shakes all the genre compliant cinematic senses. The ending, the grand finale, infuriated me, and by the looks of Morgan Freeman (coasting for easy money), he was also a little frustrated. But I had fun, yet on the flip side if anyone fronted me up and said they hated the film with a passion? Then I would understand and take them home to play with my chemistry set. 7/10",
            "A lot of people appears to have gotten into some hate-mode when watching this movie. I guess they did not check up what the movie was really about before watching it. The movie is not perfect, it has its flaws, but a 1 or 2 star bullshit rating is hugely unfair. Personally, I really liked this movie. It is science fiction, pure and simple. If you expect science without the fiction, well then you should go and see some other movie. With Luc Besson both writing and directing and statements like \u201cmerciless warrior evolved beyond human logic\u201d in the blurb \u2026 well I got pretty much what I expected.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off making you think it is a \u201csimple\u201d revenge story with science fiction elements in the form of the superhuman Lucy. However it gradually evolves into something else. Lucy knows that she cannot survive in her new state and it becomes a quest to preserve the knowledge that she has acquired while she still has the time and at the same time dodging the drug dealers that are the cause of her situation in the first place.\r\n\r\nLucy is great. Her powers and how they develop are awesome. I really like surprise effects in movies and books of the kind that you get when someone like Lucy reveals her powers to the \u201cmundane\u201d. Especially when the revealing means swatting a few bad guys. This movie is full of moments like that. It is quite a roller coaster ride of action with Lucy exhibiting her growing powers. Not too surprisingly the movie is also full of scientific bullshit and plot holes. I do not really care. I\u2019m in for the ride and it is a fun ride.\r\n\r\nScarlett Johansson is very good in her role as Lucy. Most of the other actors are ok although the Asian drug boss could have been better. He came out more like a brainless thug than anything else. Certainly not as the mastermind of a criminal organization.\r\n\r\nThe ending was a bit unsatisfactory compared to the rest of the movie though. I was a bit disappointed that the big fight at the end more or less was done without Lucy. The long cinematic sequences where Lucy wondered about in time and space felt a bit like yawn-filler-material. The actual ending, well that \u201cI am everywhere\u201d bit was really been there, seen that, done that. Also, if she was indeed everywhere, why the hurry to create that fancy memory stick?\r\n\r\nAnyway, apart from that I really enjoyed this movie.",
            "_**Time to GROW UP**_\r\n\r\n\"Lucy\" (2014) is about an average hot babe named Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi). \r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, \"Powder\" (1995) and \"Phenomenon\" (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while \"Powder\" reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's \"Youth Without Youth,\" a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include an entertaining story. \r\n\r\n\"Lucy\" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. \"Lucy\" includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, \"Lucy\" is stylish and \"hip,\" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizzazz.\r\n\r\nSome complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality. \r\n\r\nWhat's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?) \r\n\r\nIn regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? \r\n\r\nAnother example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow-motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.\r\n\r\nLess spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, \"I was thinking the exact same thing.\" What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls \"the word of knowledge.\" Although they're exaggerated in the film, they're REAL.\r\n\r\n\"Lucy\" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time \"partying\" and pursuing a \"cute guy with nice buns\" (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to \"All things in moderation\"? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.\r\n\r\nMy praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? Is that even healthy?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I love \"Lucy\"! \r\n\r\nThe film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Taiwan, France and a German airport.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A",
            "It would be easy to say this is a bad movie, if you wanted to be narrow-minded, but if you're willing to give it a chance it's really pretty good. Not great, but good. It comes at you head-on with some pretty cool and unusual perspectives. I mean, a philosophical action movie. You don't see many of those around. Ok, the philosophy falls short because the script just isn't clever enough but, it's a nice idea. And making the lead a woman was a bold touch. Bring the popcorn but keep a couple of your brain cells awake too. Oh, and if you honestly believe the myth that humans don't use 100% of their brains then there are a few scientists you need to talk to."

The world is well though out and well demonstrated. Zorg is a great bad guy, played by Gary Oldman and Bruce Willis plays his role very well. All in all a excellent movie.",
            "A simple enough concept: Guy must save a World (in the Future!) from Evil! by protecting a Magical Macguffin, only in this case it\u2019s a Girl! instead of a Thing.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s really not a lot of story here. Not a lot of character either. Why waste valuable screen time with such paltry concerns when you can instead have Chris Tucker prancing around as a flamboyant radio host in the most annoying cinematic sci-fi supporting character not created by George Lucas? Instead, the film casts actors who do a fair job of acting simply by being themselves: Bruce Wills is Korben Dallas, a brawny, shoot-first hero who, when the chips are down, is brawny and shoot-firsty. The Magical Girlfriend MacGuffin, Leeloo, is played by Mila Jovovich (in her breakout performance) and some strategically-placed wrappings (the wrappings have had a harder time breaking into more mainstream roles). Ian Holm turns up as the Old Mentor, and filling out the cast is Gary Oldman as the antagonist Zord (in his hammiest role ever).\r\n\r\nThe film seriously rises to the level of made-for-SciFi Channel-original and no higher. The plot is nonsensical, the acting committed but laughable, and the dialogue so stiff you\u2019d think the script pages had been starched.\r\n\r\nSo where does the film go legitimately wrong? Two main places: first, Besson carries on the proud tradition of French filmmakers doing weird things solely for the sake of being weird. The entire film is filled to the brim with the kind of idiosyncratic touches that I\u2019ve come to expect from that region. Most of the bits don\u2019t work, but I\u2019ll give them credit for keeping things interesting.\r\n\r\nThe second, more serious issue is another that seems to plague genre French directors, and that\u2019s the whole matter being played (largely) for farce. The most successful (creatively) American (sci-fi/)action films are defined in very large part by their villain. This film, like so many other sci-fi/action films I\u2019ve seen from French directors, never establish or maintain an element of power for the villains over the heroes. The villains are painted as clueless, moronic, out of their depth, or outright incompetent. That tradition continues here. What would Star Wars be without Darth Vader? Die Hard without Hans Gruber? Aliens without\u2026uh, aliens?\r\n\r\nLacking a strong (or even memorable) central villain (we have two: a Gary Oldman so hammy I\u2019m pretty sure Muslims couldn\u2019t work on the film, and the other being a giant planet-size ball of\u2026Pure!Evil! No joke.), the film sacrifices the one shot it had at having some kind of weight or dimension. There\u2019s no sense of danger or peril, no chance that the Hero won\u2019t triumph, and [spoilers!] the day is essentially saved by a Care Bear stare.\r\n\r\nSo, does what I\u2019ve just said make it bad? Well, yes. Let\u2019s try again. Does that made it unenjoyable? No, and it\u2019s an important distinction to make. The film is an interesting curiosity. After a half-hour of the bizarre, if you can let yourself be swept into its idiosyncratic world you\u2019ll find a perfectly watchable B (or C)-movie. It rankles a bit to think about how much was wasted making dreck this dreck-y, but it\u2019s entertaining dreck.",
            "Ever since I first watched The Fifth Element in the late 90s, I've been inspired by Gary Oldman's Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._",
            "Negative, I am a meat Popsicle.  \r\n\r\nIt's 2259 and the Earth is in mortal danger from pure evil. The only hope Earth has is something called the fifth element, which comes in the form of the newly cloned Leeloo. Along with an ex forces cab driver and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before the end of mankind arrives.\r\n\r\nDepending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a child! Here in lies the problem that many critics and movie watchers can't agree on. Just what does Luc Besson's film want to be? Having conceived the concept for his film at a very early age, Besson I think waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes- cartoonish in every other frame.\r\n\r\nCrucial though is that Besson's futuristic vision of New York dominates proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take aways anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food, how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final third.\r\n\r\nBruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged roles (Twelve Monkeys) to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives a memorable performance (oh my, is that a Southern American accent?), but it's with Mila Jovovich (Leeloo) that the film gets its acting spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has failed to progress in the acting world? (stop doing tripe like Resident \"will work for food\" Evil films would be a good start).\r\n\r\nSci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features Ian Holm (Alien) and Brion James (Blade Runner), which off sets the annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby Rhod (is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?). To leave us with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to his heart over his head, but hey baby, it's one groovy and enjoyable romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10",
            "\"The Fifth Element\" is like a journey down memory lane for me, brimming with nostalgia. I've lost count of how many times I've caught it on TV. The cast was on point, the makeup and costumes were seriously cool, and those futuristic locations were quite intriguing.\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, \"The Fifth Element\" is a certified classic. It possesses that timeless quality that's hard to find. I'd easily give it a solid 9 out of 10. But if you're a fan of this movie, you should definitely check out the animated film \"Heavy Metal\" (1981), which served as inspiration for many animation and science fiction films, including this one.",
            "I wonder how many taxi drivers get a fare they wish they's just driven past! Well I think poor \"Dallas\" (Bruce Willis) might have wished he had done that with the almost mannequin-esque \"Leeloo\" (Milla Jovovich) as he finds himself embroiled in a plot to conquer the planet. She speaks in syllables that wouldn't have been out of place in an edition of \"The Clangers\" but still manages to convey the sense of peril to mankind well enough for him to try to track down the priest \"Cornelius\" (Ian Holm) who might be able to locate some sacred stones that belong to the benign \"Fifth Element\" in time to save us from \"Mangalores\" and his evil henchman \"Mr. Zorg\" (Gary Oldman). of course, we soon learn that \"Dallas\" is no ordinary, pie-eating, cabbie. He is a former special forces ninja who is no stranger to an Uzi 9mm or to some nimble fisticuffs. Luc Besson manages to integrate some engaging comedy threat into a decent sci-fi adventure that raises a smile. Willis offers his usual style of charismatic, slightly sarcastic, delivery and Oldman (well, more his hairdo, really) camps up nicely as the baddie in charge of an army of alien soldiers who couldn't hit a cow on the tit with a tin cup. There's loads of action pretty much from the start as somehow we just know that Bruce is going to come through for us. It's a parody fo loads of other sci-fi concepts, but it does work."

            "A spectacular spectacle of a movie that faithfully adapts a French 1970s sci-fi comic book. If you think you might see it some day, you owe it to yourself to catch it in 3D on a big screen now. In a world of paint-by-numbers blockbusters, this is an invigorating slap to the eyeballs.\r\n\r\nThe flick would benefit from more focus and deliberation; often, story beats are glancing blows instead  of precision hits. The biggest flaws, however, are found in the dialogue, which is at best serviceable and at times painful, probably owing to its transition through times, languages, and mediums.\r\n\r\nValerian isn't perfect, it's a bit clunky, but the sheer unusualness, whimsy, and wonder overpowers the movie's faults, making it well worth watching.",
            "It's a fun movie, but it's not what I would call a sci fi classic. It's all spectacle, with eye popping visuals. It creates some really interesting side characters and alien worlds. The drawback is the two leads. They seem rather bland and one dimensional. Their romantic bantering is quite boring. The supporting characters are more colorful and interesting. If you are a fan of Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, you will probably enjoy this. Just don't expect anything too deep from this movie.",
            "Well, the scenes start comin' and they don't stop comin'. Aaaand that's basically the whole movie.\r\n\r\nNo, honestly by the end of it I was actually pretty on board. It took me a lot to get to that point though. The ham-fisted romance subplot they kept awkwardly grinding the movie to a standstill for was chief amongst the swill I felt I had to wade through to get to that point of enjoyment. The primary alien race being the most poorly animated was another. But somewhere between the Rhianna actually being bearable in this, and the Ethan Hawke character I want to see 500 more times, I did actually somewhat enjoy _Valerian_... Somewhat.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
            "I guess I am going to disagree both with the critics, wich of course is not at all unusual, as well as with a lot of the actual viewers of this movie by saying that I really liked this movie.\n\nI guess that I can to some extent understand that some viewers are disappointed. That would be the viewers that have read the comics that the movie is based on. Unfortunately someone in the production team decided to take bits and pieces from several comic books and mash them together as well as change some key elements. It is really annoying when that is done. It is usually an indication that somewhere some dumbass who did not understand, and certainly did not respect, the source material had way too much influence on the production. It is really a shame since the comic book from wich the core of the of the story seems to be taken is certainly more than good enough to stand on its own.\n\nWell luckily the mashup that they produced is actually bloody good. Something wich in my experience is quite rare. The Valerian comics lends themselves very well as a base for some spectacular sci-fi  with plenty of weird creatures and spectacular scenery. Add Luc Besson to the mix and you have to spell spectacular in all caps.\n\nThis is definitely a Luc Besson movie. Plenty of action, spectacular (yes I repeat myself but this movie deserves it) scenery, a fair amount of weirdness. In short a lot of stuff this particular viewer likes.\n\nThe mashed up story is not too bad. It is predictable as hell of course, even though it is not following the comics, but it is making a decent job of tying together all the action and FX and the action and FX is really the main reason to watch this movie after all.\nI have to say that I think most of the characters were pretty okay. It seems that the performance of the two main characters where generally not so well received by a lot of people. I guess I can somewhat understand that but I still cannot refrain from saying: Read the fucking comics! Okay it is a French comic and there are probably few people outside of France (or at least outside of Europe) that have read them. Me being one of the few of course. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are supposed to be somewhat weird, silly and a little bit childish. Personally I think they did a fair job of interpreting the comic book characters the way they should be. We probably have Luc Besson to thank for not getting a some Hollywood, thirteen on a dozen, characters.\n\nI do miss some bits of the real comics though. The transmutation animal played a much more visible role in the comic and so did the three information peddlers wich gave a much more professional impression in the comic book by the way. I also think it was a shame that they changed the story of the Muh so much. Their role in the comic book was much more impressive to me.\n\nStill, most of the bits and pieces that is taken from the different comic books and mashed together are quite faithfully reproduced, at least visually and the results turned out really really good as far as I am concerned.\n\nTo wrap it up, to me, this movie was a fun, spectacular, action filled sci-fi extravaganza. A typical Luc Besson movie and I mean that in a good way.",
            "I like this Movie very much. It reminds a bit about Avatar & John Carter. I can not Understand why it did Not make it to the Australian Cinemas. For this type of High Budget it would be worth watching in 3D Cinemas.\r\nI gave it 10/10 **********",
            "A disorrienting but somewhat delightful run through all manner of sci-fi imaginations. The acting was not good, and the storyline was sometimes incoherent, yet I have this strange urge to rewatch this thing. It's harmless, fascinating fun, in ways like the original starwars experience (though much more visually spectacular, and much less narratively coherent).",
            "I'm conflicted by this film. \r\n\r\nThe good is really great. I think the settings are some of the best in any sci-fi movie I've watched. Luc Besson's style shines through ala Fifth Element. The visual and special effects combine with the settings to make this just spectacular to watch. The plot and action provide solid support.\r\n\r\nBut the bad is truly awful. The selection of Dane DeHaan in the lead is one of the worst casting mistakes I've come across. He is completely unbelievable in the role and nothing like the character in the source material. Cara Delevingne scrapes by but the two of them struggle to deliver their roles and have zero chemistry. Even Clive and Ethan aren't at their best, with Rihanna being one of the best performances. They aren't helped by some very poorly written dialog. With so many good actors and writers out there these two big mistakes should never have happened.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately those mistakes turned what should have been a sci-fi gem closer to painful mediocrity.",
            "Great world, great action, great miscast\r\n\r\nDane de Haan sounds like a teenager trying to sound like a grown-up ordering porn from the video store with dad's credit card. He's not the bratty guy that gets on Cara's nerves and into her heart.\r\n\r\nThat would be Ryan Goslin, Chris Evans or Chris Pratt, but I reckon they had their schedules full. Since much of the movie depends on the banter between Cara and Dane, you can see Cara is trying and rescues a bunch of scenes, but it just doesn't work. It's a real shame. On top of that, he misses the hero charm and charisma that's needed to pull off a believable \"invaluable resource\".\r\n\r\nSo enjoy the good parts (the word building, the action scenes and Rihanna's performance) and try to gloss over the bad."

Every time I didn\u2019t think the film could possibly get any better, C\u00e9line Sciamma elevated it to even greater, more incomprehensible heights, culminating in one of the most extraordinary moments in 21st-century cinema. This is a rare and precious film, breathtaking in its craft and intensely honest in its passions. This is a film that aches, that longs, that dances in ecstasy and raises its hands to the sky, angelic and ferocious and perfect. Simply put, \u2019Portrait of a Lady on Fire\u2019 is a masterpiece, and one of the best films of this or any year.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-a-perfect-film-on-the-language-of-desire",

This is an impeccably detailed, beautifully acted, refined drama with a strong feminist angle that\u2019s as stirring as it is thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nMarianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant) is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel), a young woman who has just left the convent. Because H\u00e9lo\u00efse is a very reluctant bride-to-be, Marianne arrives under the guise of companionship, observing the smallest of details about the woman by day and secretly painting her by firelight at night. As the two women spend their days with one another, intimacy and attraction grow, and the portrait becomes a symbol of the intensity of their love.\r\n\r\nThe lead performances are mannered and structured in the most effective way. The strong desire between the two women is manifested in a gaze or careful examination of a wisp of hair or the way H\u00e9lo\u00efse crosses her hands. There\u2019s a quiet intensity to the emotional and physical intimacy between these two women, making this love story\u2019s end feel all the more heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly an all-female film, and the men briefly seen on screen play little importance. Rounding out the characters are H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s mother (Valeria Golino) and housekeeper Sophie (Lu\u00e0na Bajrami), who both fill critical roles in the story as the film explores issues affecting women at the time, including arranged marriages, career expectations, and health concerns.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is absolutely stunning, with gorgeously romantic and lush cinematography by Claire Mathon setting a sensual tone that complements the story. The artistry is outstanding, making \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire\u201d one of the most powerful, intellectual dramas of the year.",

            "<b>INT. THE ANATOMY OF ANATOMY OF A FALL - DAY</b>\r\n<i>Anatomy of a Fall</i> is an excellent film crafted from the mind of Justine Triet. It's beautifully acted, shot, scored and edited together. So let's look at the Anatomy of <i>Anatomy of a Fall</i>.\r\n \r\nStory:\r\nThe story revolves around the unconfirmed cause of death of <i>Samuel</i>, who has fallen out of his attic window. The only person in the house was his wife <i>Sandra</i>, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>, the prime suspect. Their son <i>Daniel</i>, blind from an unfortunate event, is the only witness. The story is from the perspective of <i>Sandra</i>, and just like any courtroom drama, details are revealed over time. Fortunately, it's at a steady pace, never announcing too much or too little, giving us the correct information at the right time. While I'm mostly positive about the story, some moments slow right down, and we come to a standstill; overall, thanks to the following few components, they considerably make up for the story's flaws. \r\n\r\nPerformance: \r\nIts lead is <i>Anatomy of a Fall's</i> greatest asset, <b>Sandra H\u00fcller</b>. She is tremendous, pulling no punches in the role of Sandra, the deceased's wife. For the rest of the cast, no one except the dog is ever greater than Sandra! \r\n\r\nCinematography: \r\nThe camera in this film is on a swivel, always moving, keeping us engaged. The camera uses Visual humour quite a bit, which is always great to see. Finally, the colour grade felt natural and, at times, warm, giving a homely vibe. \r\n\r\nScore:\r\nA simple piano piece plays throughout the film; it is excellent. \r\nFinally, the editing:\r\nThis was a stand-out for me. It was cleverly cutting at points to hide us from the horrors but holding onto moments before it became too much. \r\nThere's a lot of love about this film \u2014 a highlight of the Cannes 2023 run. \r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT.</b>",
            "When young \"Daniel\" (Milo Machado Graner) returns from a walk in the snow with his dog (\"Snoop\") he discovers the body of his father lying on the snow in front of their alpine house. He shouts for his mother, writer \"Sandra\" (Sandra H\u00fcller) and soon the police investigation is out to establish just what happened. What do we know? Well, not a lot really - just that before the young man left for his stroll, his mother was giving an interview in their kitchen to a journalist that was being increasingly drowned out by the intrusive music emanating from her husband upstairs, and - that young \"Daniel\" is blind. \"Sandra\" enlists the help of a friend who represents her as after many a re-enactment the authorities conclude that there is enough evidence that she lobbed him over the balcony and murdered him. A curiously relaxed courtroom drama now ensues. Those of us used to watching British or American scenarios like this might find the approach, usually entirely speculative, taken by prosecuting counsel to essentially draw his own conclusion from evidence that may or not be there is quite entertaining to watch. The President of the tribunal rarely intercedes in what becomes a frequently unsubstantiated analysis of the sometimes turbulent marriage of the two, we learn of the cause of the boy's blindness, of his mother's sexuality and by the denouement I felt that Justine Triet had worked well with a strong cast to create a whodunit where there might have been no crime at all! That denouement is a little rushed, but leaves a lovely degree of doubt in the mind of the one member of the cast who probably needed convincing the most! It's just a shade too long, a wee bit too much build up, but once it's in full swing this is a strongly performed, sometimes quite funny and dark crime drama that is well worth a watch.",
            "It\u2019s always disappointing when a film aspires to greatness that it never achieves. Such is the case with the latest offering from French writer-director Justine Triet, whose allegedly suspenseful thriller is about as appetizing as a plate of tepid leftovers. This crime investigation/courtroom drama about the mysterious death of a middle-aged unsuccessful writer (Samuel Theis) who falls from the second story of his mountain chalet looks into whether his demise is due to suicide or murder, with his wife (Sandra H\u00fcller), herself a best-selling author, being the prime suspect. Despite an intriguing premise, however, the movie is overlong, needlessly talky and inherently flat, with a cold, clinical, unengaging narrative and characters who engender no connection, compassion or empathy. In essence, this is a \u201cwhodunnit\u201d that plays like an extended \u201cwhocares.\u201d Fault the screenplay here, which seeks to tell a tale in the same gripping vein as such great courtroom dramas as \u201cAnatomy of a Murder\u201d (1959) but that never achieves the level of tension, mystery and audience engagement needed to pull that off. The meticulously orchestrated script feels calculated and derivative virtually from start to finish, especially in its trial sequences, which explore an array of possible motives and explanations, including everything from infidelity to plagiarism to previous suicide attempts, that rely on often-implausible speculation and inflated conjecture to carry forward a proceeding that probably never should have ended up in court in the first place. What\u2019s more, the double entendre that is the picture\u2019s title is so obvious that any hopes of nuance, subtlety or profundity evaporate quickly once the failing nature of the couple\u2019s troubled relationship surfaces. While the film admittedly features a fine performance by H\u00fcller, it\u2019s far from enough to rescue a picture with big aspirations that never pan out. How this release has garnered so much exaggerated awards season buzz is beyond me, especially given its intrinsically insipid, underwhelming, overstated character. There are plenty of other films of this ilk out there that are far more worth watching than this one, so grab one of those better selections instead and give this one the well-earned pass it genuinely deserves.",
            "French movie with a drama / courtroom theme that is gripping more into it's realistic tone than others movies that create unexpected and unbelievable tones, directed by Justine Triet from a screenplay she co-wrote with Arthur Harari (Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle).\r\n\r\nCurrently it is the winner of Canne's Palm D'or and nominated for five Academy awards, being those Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Original Screenplay, Best Achievement in Film Editing. \r\n\r\nIt tells the story of In an isolated mountain chalet near Grenoble, where the problematic couple French Samuel Maleski is playing music in his attic so loudly that interrupts an interview of his German wife, Sandra Voyter (played by Sandra H\u00fcller), and son Daniel (partially blind), returns from a long walk with his guide dog Snoop to find Samuel dead below his attic window. \r\n\r\nFrom there and all the theories, criminal analysis and courtroom judicial processes guide the movie and gain the midia of the country. Do not expect CSI level invention on this one - it is logical and reasonable as a movie that analyses the crisis in the couple and the impact on the son with a heavy focus on the courtroom that gabs your attention.\r\n\r\nSandra H\u00fcller is the protagonist that leads with an incredible performance on her role. The direction is solid as well as the screenplay. The cinematography varies from formal takes to more active ones and the editing is perfect in joining all the takes.\r\n\r\nI usually found courtroom movies to be boring but this wasn't the case that holds your attention till the end even with the slow moving of events and investigations from the live of protagonists to the dispute of the lawyers.\r\n\r\nA strong contender for all the prizes but knowing the academy I am almost sure it will grab 2 to 3 prizes.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view the movie is a 8,5 out of 10,0 / A. For sure one of the movies of 2023 that must be seen, so it gets a like from me too.",
            "An engrossing, if perhaps slightly over-acclaimed, courtroom drama that masterfully balances suspense with emotional depth. Triet delves into the ambiguities of truth, relationships, and the narratives we construct to navigate complex realities. H\u00fcller delivers a standout performance as a woman under intense scrutiny, her nuanced portrayal adding layers to the unfolding mystery.\r\n\r\nThe courtroom scenes are riveting, weaving meticulous legal procedures with the raw tension of a marital drama. The film\u2019s structure is sharp and deliberate, keeping you hooked as it probes the blurred lines between guilt and innocence.\r\n\r\nAlso, what an awful choice in music :O"

            "**An extreme desire for blood and flesh!**\r\n\r\nTotally unexpected. I had no idea what I'm about to watch. Because usually I do small research of films I watch before the click play. I did not know it was even a French film or a horror. But it was not actually a horror in a sense. Seeing the initial set up, I thought it would be about a freshman medical student. Then things turned out strangely. Like it was decades ago when I was young, I have felt uncomfortable for those intentional film. For this, it felt all real. As the contents, I disliked them. But the film succeeded if that's what it's intended to give to its audience.\r\n\r\nIt lived up to what the title meant. But on the other hand, I thought it was making fun of vegetarians. You usually won't find many vegetarians in Europe, but this film's topic was bizarre. Because you know someone who has never consumed meat in his entire life, but then when he begins this new habit, it is like completely going out of control. It's not just one, but two from the same family. Something was very clear, that one not knowing the differences. Because they were never before used to it.\r\n\r\nJustine is all set to join her sister to practice to be a veterinarian. Coming from a pure vegetarian family, she has to go through some of college traditions. From the beginning itself, it did not go well for her. It affected her health and body. A drastic change in a short period of time, forcing her to uncontrollable desire. Then on one accidental situation, it turns even worst. Ultimately, a conflict between the sisters arise. It takes them to unexpected paths and finally how it all ends were revealed with many uneasy events.\r\n\r\n> -xX] An animal that has tasted human flesh isn't safe. [Xx-\r\n\r\nI have seen many films like this, but this one was a stand-alone from all of them. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but they have got all things right just as they wanted. Obviously this is for grownups, though not all of them can watch without feeling disgust. Some of article, reviews says, people left the cinema hall halfway through. A very challenging film to watch. You might think I'm exaggerating for a simple cinematic performance, but that's what I really experienced. Only when you give it a try, you might get it.\r\n\r\nA bit confusing as the story progressing. Like what kind of universe, it is set in. Because whatever happens around Justine, seems nobody caring. Where were the professors! So many doubts. It's just what it is. An imaginative perspective, what if kind of situation turned more uglier. But if you analyse it properly, the only issue was the cannibalism. Not that one showing a desire in consuming meat all of sudden. So, I appreciate the writing, direction and performances, but definitely it is not my cup of tea. Probably for most of you as well.\r\n\r\nSo this is not for all, but selected viewers. Films can be anything, only we have to assert whether we liked it or not. The maker knew what they were doing, the kind of subject they have undertaken for their film. Often a film like this hits the screen, and makes some noise among the film critics and film goers. I don't know on what merit one should decide to watch it. Because it is not for entertainment, nor an art, nor a message film. But I still think it is worth a watch. Just be aware of what you are going to watch.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

            "**Man always needs a purpose.**\r\n\r\nSince the Hollywood upgraded to the 3D animation, the rest of the world took over and given some incredible films in the last one and half decades. The Japanese animes are undoubtedly the best, but the European animation, particularly the 2D animation started to boom in the recent times with special mention goes to Tomm Moore. So basically I might miss some Hollywood animations, right now, but I'm very watchful over this kind of films. That's how I watched it, but anyway I would have seen it.\r\n\r\nThis is the director's first feature animation film, but he was known for his awesome short animations which one of them won him an Oscar. It was jointly produced by three countries, including Japan's Studio Ghibli. It's their first non-Japanese production and a great beginning and timing to expand the production in other continents. Especially after their legend, Hayao Miyazaki retired from the filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe film was short like the 80 minute stretch without a single word spoken in its entire narration. There's no even sign language used, everything's actions and reactions. So you would find empty in the film's cast section which is kind of weird. I mean there are characters in the film, but all were imaginations without names and what year it takes place, where with so many questions like that. Basically to say, a film without the cast, but the crew members managed to give the best to the viewers to get it without any struggle.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, that the film is very enjoyable. It is a fantasy film, so whatever you see, you have to accept it. Because that's how things happen in a theme like this, all fictional. Though, the first thing you have to keep in your mind is not the entire film was an hallucination event. There are some dreamy events and that's fine since the film character is coping with loneliness.\r\n\r\nA man who had lost at sea, wakes up in a small island. It's a life supporting land mass with fresh water and fruits, but he also has to put some effort for fishing. His notion is to leave the island as soon as possible to go back to where he had come from, the civilised world. In his every attempt to sail with a raft he had made using bamboos, fails to cross after a certain stretch of the island coast. He later comes to know what stopped him and with an anger reaction he commits a mistake. So now he has to come out of the guilt and to do that he chooses what seems the right.\r\n\r\nIt was like a simple story without any meaning about everything that's shown in it. So in my entire watch I thought the same and said it was an okay film with great animation. But the ending changed my stance. That twist, I don't think everybody would understand. But one thing I want to make sure if you yet to see it, that it was about the purpose. The man always looks for a reason to do things and even to live or die. That's where the red turtle comes in.\r\n\r\nAlthough my biggest question is, is this film a follow-up or in any way connected to the director's previous short animation 'Father and Daughter'? Because it seems the man who got lost in the sea is from that short film. But it never revealed the reason why he was stopped by whomever from return home. Also, both the conclusions syncs. It's just a my theory, so only the director can explain that.\r\n\r\nI'm very sure this film is in the Oscars race. If it fails to make, then its not my prediction was wrong, but the Academy Awards people got it all wrong. I'm also sure it won't win as 3D animation dominated world, particularly 'Zootopia' 'Finding Dory' and 'Moana' are taking the first three frontrunner spots. Except the technical differences, only the grown ups can say this one has a better and meaningful story. It is very similar to 'Ponyo', but a grown-up's version. Anyway, it is a must see film, especially the adults and in particular those who always think animation is for children. If they see it, they might change their mind. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n8/10",
            "The Red Turtle is a dialogue free film. That may turn a lot of people off. However, it fit the mood of the movie perfectly. It's a fantasy film that is filled with pure undefiled love. You will find yourself wanting your own family after this one. The ending is left open to interpretation but only makes the plot seem that much more interesting when you try to unravel who/what is the Red Turtle. A definite watch for those looking for more than the typical Hollywood blockbuster.",

He's pretty ill-equipped for his new lifestyle and is gradually starving! What to do? Well he has a go at building a raft, but each time he sets off it ends up as little more than kindling. After one such incident, he concludes that his antagonist is a beautiful sea turtle that he has observed nearby. When it comes onto land one day, he flips it over and leaves it to perish in the hot sun. Magic has an hand to play now, though, as the creatures morphs into a young woman with whom he gradually starts to bond and... The animation and soundtrack on this dialogue-free feature are gorgeous. The story itself has a brevity and engagingly fantastic nature to it. What makes something paradise? What keeps something paradise? It felt a little long at ninety minutes and don't be expecting any great conclusions at the end, but it still flew by and I really liked it's simplicity.",

            "\"The Red Turtle: A Meditation on Be Here Now\"\r\n\r\nIn Michael Dudok de Wit's masterful animated film, a simple narrative becomes a profound exploration of human resilience and spiritual surrender. Without a single spoken word, the film communicates a universal truth: we are precisely where we are meant to be, even when that reality feels like a constraint.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a castaway on a deserted island, initially consumed by the urge to escape. His repeated attempts to build rafts, only to have them mysteriously destroyed, mirror our human tendency to resist our current circumstances. The red turtle - more a spiritual guide than a mere animal - becomes the catalyst for transformation.\r\n\r\nVisually stunning, with a delicate, watercolor-like animation style, the film breathes life into its minimalist landscape. Each frame is meticulously composed, each movement deliberate. The timing is exquisite, allowing moments of tension and release to resonate deeply.\r\n\r\nWhat elevates this film is its universal message: true liberation comes not from fighting our situation, but from accepting it. The protagonist's journey is less about physical survival and more about spiritual awakening.\r\n\r\nA profound, poetic meditation on life's cycles and the art of being present."

Jackson).\u00a0 Darius is incarcerated but makes a deal to testify in exchange for his wife (Selma Hayek), being granted freedom.\u00a0 Darius knows he is a marked man but takes the chance and under the watch of Interpol Agent Roussel (Elodie Yung), they set off.\r\nNaturally things do not go as planned and the two find themselves fleeing for their lives with numerous deadly assassins hot on their heels.\u00a0 Unsure who she can trust, Roussel calls in Michael even though they have some seriously unresolved issues about one another that destroyed their previous relationship. Further complicating matters is the history Michael and Darius share which makes them naturally hostile to one another.\r\nNevertheless, Michael and Darius set off to reach the courtroom but the imposed deadline and face numerous dangers and hilarious situations along the way.\r\nJackson and Reynolds work very well with one another and their banter and chiding comes across as very natural.\u00a0 The jokes come more often than I expected but the film is very much an action film, and the sequences are intense, funny, and gripping, especially and extended chase and fight sequence along the canals and shopping district of Amsterdam.\r\nWhile some may say that the film is just a variation on the Buddy Cop genre of old, the strong cast and the winning mix of jokes and action make the film a very pleasant surprise and one of my more enjoyable films of 2017. It was a highly-enjoyable thrill ride and one of the best films this summer.\r\nIf you are a fan of action, comedies, and the pairing of Jackson and Reynolds, do not miss this film.\r\n4 stars out of 5.",
            "_The Hitman's Bodyguard_ is getting absolutely flensed by the critics, including several of whom I personally value the opinion of very highly. But when it comes to _The Hitman's Bodyguard_, I gotta flat out disagree. It's not out here changing lives for the better, and it's hardly gonna ride out the year on a palanquin of Oscar nominations, but I had a seriously enjoyable time with The Hitman's Bodyguard. Jackson and Reynolds worked. The leads and their respective romantic entanglements worked. Most of all, director Patrick Hughes worked his ass of to blend comedy, action and romance and have it pay off. This isn't Hughes' best work though, if you want to see that, check out 2010's _Red Hill_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "**Once upon a time two sworn enemies teamed up!**\r\n\r\nMaybe the critics are right, but like usual, I don't have to agree with them. This is a nice film, not a great film as a few people lauding. It is entertaining. All the stunts were good, comedies were good enough, but the basic plot itself a cliche. Yes, anybody aged 20+ would surely have seen many similar storied films. It's just in another time with another cast and crew. They had promoted it so well. So the result was incredible. But in reality JUST one time watchable film with not expecting serious laughs.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought it could be this year's 'The Nice Guys', and they are about to repeat the same magic of Crowe and Gosling duo. But it was different. Too hard hitting, just what Tarantino fans would like to have. Besides, their guy, Samuel L. Jackson is here. Both the leads were good. That does not mean they have saved the film. That's an assumption of fanboys. Luck could be another factor!\r\n\r\nIt was about a hitman in capture decides to give an important testimony in the International Criminal Court against a powerful man. So now the bad guys are after him in his every move from England to Holland. A demoted bodyguard takes the job to safely get him to his destination. Their journey begins where they are going to encounter a series of obstacles and they finally make it where a major twist comes in before the end.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this is no special, except the way they have presented on the screen makes the difference. But again, not all films are lucky in that criteria as this one. It is like one in a 20-25 films. So if your objective is timepass, then this will do just fine. There could be a sequel, probably prequel seems a nice idea. But I'm not sure whether I want it or not. I'll just be happy if they do!\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/malignant-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Malignant is yet another excellent origin movie for a new franchise created by one of the most successful horror filmmakers of the century, James Wan. The talented director picks up a thematically rich, mysteriously intriguing narrative written by the feature film debutant Akela Cooper, and lets himself get inspired by the giallo genre. Boasting a fascinating protagonist brilliantly interpreted by Annabelle Wallis, the unexpected yet exposition-heavy revelations of the brave third act definitely improve upon a rather generic, unexciting first half. While the impressive action sequences steal the technical spotlight, Joseph Bishara's score holds divisive creative choices that might not please every viewer. For horror fans, I couldn't recommend it more.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "This is one of the dumbest films I have seen in a long time, start to finish it is a dumpster fire, the \"twist\" is projected so hard so early, and so often, then over explained to the point of the death of any subtlety, and it's not original or clever in it's execution. \r\n\r\nI don't understand how people seem to be liking this film I feel like I'm taking crazy pills\r\n\r\nI rarely say this, but I hated this dumb film",
            "Classic case of the trailer being the best part. I'll hand it to them though, I was completely fooled about what this movie was going to be. When they showed Gabriel behind the plastic sheet in the beginning ... I knew it was not what I signed on for.\r\n\r\nAs my mom would say: It insults my intelligence. ",
            "This movie has started very strong  the ending was a little bit silly but it was  fun i like this movie it's better than any of the other horror movies that come out in 2020 and 2021 ok  the conjuring 3 was  the best this movie is on my second place",
            "I'll give it this much, it's a weird movie. Can't say it's a good weird nor a bad one, just plain weird. Now, I do appreciate that James Wan returned to his horror roots in between the wait for Aquaman 2 goes into production.\r\n\r\nAs for this movie, there was parts that felt off, such as the acting which I don't think was all that impressive. Wan's direction wasn't particularly noteworthy either outside of the finale which had impressive moments. As a whole, the least I can say it's not pedestrian or forgettable, but on the other hand I really don't have much desire to revisit. **2.75/5**",
            "Malignant is a ride, one that changes directions in multiple different ways that I did not expect. This film is an ambitious genre bend that takes tropes from slashers (loved the Friday the 13th/Halloween cords used in the beginning of the film), the classic James Wan ghost films, action, and strangely enough some elements from Scream in the comedy side. With some many different themes it was hard to really understand what this movie's identity was. The film had a serious tone throughout but had some awkward lines that felt right out of a Scream film. With those two different tones it felt as if the lines were funny bad writing rather than artistic vision.\r\n\r\nThe kills were bloody as all hell, which is par for the course with the slasher genre and a positive for this film. The reversed humanoid figure visuals for the killer were very incredibly unsettling.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the plot for the most part, even though I felt the beginning and the end were much stronger than the middle lull. The twist was great, and I did not see it coming till it was almost too late. When this happens the movie really finds it grove and kept me locked in for the remaining twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nOverall, Malignant is decent movie, maybe a little too ambitious for its own good.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_",
            "<b>70/100</b>\r\n\r\nIn <i>Malignant</i>, director James Wan crafts a visually-impressive horror experience in which camera work, production design, and aesthetics do most of the heavy lifting. Annabelle Wallis and her Backpack do their best with a garbage script and subpar supporting cast that appears to be there to punch the ticket. If you can get over the slow opening 30 minutes, <i>Malignant</i>'s innovative ideas distinguish it from the usual horror movie clich\u00e9s, giving surprising turns that keep you intrigued until the end.",
            "I really liked this film. It wasn't that scary, but it did gross me out a lot. This is a horror film that feels like it didn't want to be terrifying but wanted to show us what is terrifying. The threat of the film was an interesting concept, and the film did a great job of making me invested in the story that is unfolding as you watch it. The ending felt a little loose, and I feel it should have gone a little longer, so it could have been a better end, but other than that, this was a great film, and I'd recommend it to anyone."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never seen a movie from Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, but Pieces of a Woman started getting the usual awards buzz that comes with this time of the year. Once Netflix grabbed the distribution rights, it was just a matter of time until I got the chance to watch yet another Oscar-bait. I didn\u2019t really think about it nor created any sort of expectations besides hoping it would be good. Vanessa Kirby (Mission: Impossible - Fallout, Hobbs & Shaw) and Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy) are the protagonists of a story that will connect with many people around the world, especially couples who went through the same situation. I\u2019ll write it straight away: it\u2019s undoubtedly one of the best films I\u2019ve seen this past year.\r\n\r\nHow does it stand in comparison with the other marvelous movies? I\u2019ll have to think about it when organizing my Top10, but Pieces of a Woman possesses the best opening act I\u2019ve seen in quite a long time. For thirty full minutes (even before the title card shows up), an entire birth scene is delivered through excruciatingly long, uninterrupted takes, which ultimately make the whole sequence feel like a phenomenal oner. Technically, the entire film is brilliantly directed by Mundrucz\u00f3, who takes advantage of the superb cinematography from Benjamin Loeb and Howard Shore\u2019s beautiful score to offer the viewer an emotionally powerful viewing experience.\r\n\r\nAs fantastic as the technical attributes may be, Kata W\u00e9ber\u2019s exceptionally well-written, detailed screenplay is really elevated by the incredible cast, notably its leads. Without the shadow of a doubt, Vanessa Kirby gives her career-best performance, demonstrating an emotional range I genuinely believed she didn\u2019t have. Martha\u2019s arc ends up being a tad predictable and formulaic as some other characters\u2019 arcs and portions of the narrative, but I never felt less invested in the story due to that. In fact, I can\u2019t remember the last movie that brought tears to my eyes before the end of the first act, which serves as a statement of the film\u2019s realism and authenticity.\r\n\r\nShia LaBeouf might have also delivered his best interpretation ever, even though I truly love a couple of his past displays. Once again, the actor brings his A-game, demonstrating the talented acting skills that make him one of the most underrated actors working today, in my opinion. A particular aspect of Sean\u2019s arc left me a bit dubious of its necessity and/or importance to the narrative, but just like Kirby\u2019s character, I was always interested in their path. Molly Parker is also excellent as the midwife involved in the tragedy, while Ellen Burstyn portrays Martha\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, leaving me deeply surprised by her outstanding performance. 88 years old\u2026 Magnificent.\r\n\r\nDespite the highly expected developments and respective conclusions, the ending shares a touching revelation involving a particular trait from Kirby\u2019s character that hit me really hard. The best aspect of the entire movie has a negative side effect, though. After such a mesmerizing, powerful, shocking first act, the rest of the film never quite reaches the same level of investment and immersiveness that the initial thirty minutes are packed with. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still a remarkably captivating narrative, filled with significant messages of forgiveness, acceptance, fairness, and another take on the \u201cmoving on\u201d matter.\r\n\r\nIt will be extremely hard to watch for many people, but it\u2019s that realistic environment that left me speechless and surprisingly emotional right from the get-go. It might not be a movie that I\u2019ll rewatch countless times or even recommend to every single reader. Nevertheless, Pieces of a Woman carries an undeniably impactful story that tons of viewers will share a deep connection with, which every filmmaker tries hard to accomplish. Ultimately, concerning my Top10, it will come down to how much I value its immense quality vs. its low replay value.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Pieces of a Woman becomes a worthy awards contender, holding one of the best opening acts of the last few years. With astonishing direction from Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, the first thirty minutes are packed with extreme levels of anxiety and stress due to the emotionally shocking birth sequence, which is played out through excruciatingly long takes. Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf deliver their career-best performances, handling extensive monologues effortlessly, but it\u2019s the former who leaves me mind-blowed at her emotional range, which induced tears in my eyes even before the title card. Kata W\u00e9ber\u2019s exceptional screenplay is brought to life in a remarkably authentic, immersive manner, leaving me incredibly captivated by its characters, despite the formulaic and predictable arcs. Huge praise to Howard Shore\u2019s wonderful score, and Benjamin Loeb\u2019s terrific camera work, as well as Molly Parker and Ellen Burstyn\u2019s excellent displays. I highly recommend it to anyone who\u2019d love to watch an emotionally investing story with phenomenal acting but be advised: it can extremely hard to watch at times.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "'Pieces of a Woman' demonstrates how sometimes, even despite everyone trying their best, dark outcomes happen, and we don't always get an answer for why. Thankfully, it also shows that there is a path for achieving post-traumatic growth, even under the most shattering of circumstances.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-pieces-of-a-woman-the-ripple-effect-of-grief",
            "I feel like I can\u2019t review \u201cPieces of a Woman\u201d without first addressing the elephant in the room: the horrific and violent abuse claims against lead actor Shia LaBeouf. They\u2019re so bad that Netflix has taken the man\u2019s name off most ads for the film and, especially considering the subject matter, it seems appropriate. LaBeouf gives an absolutely heartbreaking performance, but the allegations surrounding the actor make some of the material feel very upsetting (in particular, a scene where LaBeouf\u2019s character tries to force unwanted sex on his partner). But to dismiss this film would be unfair to the those who worked so hard both in front of and behind the camera.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Martha (Vanessa Kirby) and her partner Sean (LaBeouf) over the course of a year, set off by the new mother\u2019s home birth that ends in an unthinkable tragedy at the hands of a flustered midwife (Molly Parker). The grief begins to overwhelm the young couple, who are coping in very different ways. The first part of the movie highlights the deep love between the two but as the months tick on, their relationship become more fractured. Making things worse is Martha\u2019s domineering mother Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), who never liked Sean and sees her daughter as a failure.\r\n\r\nDirector Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3 has fashioned a gripping portrait of loss and grief that rests firmly on Kirby\u2019s shoulders. She gives a raw, physical and emotional performance that is truly outstanding. She and Burstyn create a realistic family dynamic which finally explodes when Martha and Elizabeth have a tense standoff over dinner. Mom wants her daughter to deal with the tragedy head-on instead of continuing to bury the pain. It\u2019s one of the strongest scenes in the film, and the two actors make it unforgettable.\r\n\r\nThe film has a melancholy atmosphere and tone that complements the subject matter. Everything is increasingly bleak and drab as Martha and Sean continue to make a series of bad-to-worse decisions and behaviors that eventually destroy their lives together. They deal with grief in varying ways. She bottles her sadness inside while he lashes out with increased aggression. That\u2019s part of what makes this story such a personal journey and makes it feel achingly authentic.\r\n\r\nDespite its flaws (including a lousy ending and numerous metaphors about building bridges and growing apples), \u201cPieces of a Woman\u201d doesn\u2019t shy away from presenting an unflinching look at deeply wounded humans who are devastated by grief. It\u2019s a tough film to watch, but it\u2019s an effective, intimate look at bereavement, agony, and a pain that no one could possibly heal.",
            "I totally get why this film has so many award nominations. The film deals with a difficult, very real, subject - how the loss of a child affects the relationships of those around him/her. But honestly, outside of a tremendous performance by Vanessa Kirby, this film is just average or worse. The subject was so much more finely dealt with in the brilliant Ordinary People.",
            "Maybe there's a good movie in the script.\r\n\r\nCan't say, the actual movie is one of those productions where \"HDR\" means \"Hundred% Darkness Rules,\" I can hardly make out what's going on on the screen.\r\n\r\nTurned it off after five minutes.

            "Overrated? Most assuredly, but utterly engaging from beginning to end. Not Yorgos' most humorous piece, but technically sound and brilliantly acted.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nThe Favourite is one of the most acclaimed movies of last year, receiving multiple nominations at dozens of awards shows and winning a whole bunch of them (2nd most awarded film of 2018, behind Roma). Being a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 style, I couldn\u2019t be happier for him, and I was now even more excited to watch what he produced and directed. This movie is a classic example of an Oscars\u2019 tradition of sorts. A lot of audience members make their mission to watch every Best Picture nominee before the big night, and there\u2019s always one film that people fail to grasp on why did it get so much praise? Why are critics all around the world absolutely loving what audiences perceive as an \u201cokay\u201d time at the theater, but which contains a long, weird and maybe even dull (for some) story?\r\n\r\nWell, first of all, this is technically a masterpiece. I mean, every single technical aspect is worthy of recognition. The production and set design are gorgeously eyegasmic. The score is unusual for a period piece like this, but it weirdly works, as it continuously elevates the tension between the three main characters and helps the story flow with an always conspicuous, treacherous feeling. Even the cinematography and the plays with candlelight offer some pretty neat scenes. However, and prepare to be surprised, the costume design steals the show from all the other achievements. This is coming from a guy who has utterly no interest in this particular matter and who rarely talks about it, so I\u2019m as surprised as you are. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not due to the costumes being pretty or appropriate to the time period. Almost every movie that tackles these times nail the costume design, but only a few can tell a character arc through it. Even less are capable of embodying the whole screenplay like this Oscar-bait does. Our protagonists have distinct journeys, but their ends all have similarities. One way of understanding the story is through what they wear, which seamlessly represent the arc that each character takes to get where they eventually end up. These layers of storytelling keep the film intriguing, but Lanthimos\u2019 uncommon methods plus McNamara and Davis\u2019 script will displease some audience members.  \r\n\r\nThe Favourite is that movie that audiences are going to be perplexed about why do critics adore it. There\u2019s no secret, really. Audience members don\u2019t care about the technical part of films. They couldn\u2019t care less about costume design, cinematography, score or how the screenplay is written. They want to be entertained and have a good time at the theater, so I find reasonable if people leave a bit disappointed with one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2018. Lanthimos doesn\u2019t deliver formulaic stories, and he certainly doesn\u2019t film them in a regular fashion, so I firmly believe the general public isn\u2019t really going to enjoy this one. His unique style brings a very different tone, pace and filming techniques that people aren\u2019t used to experiencing. Fortunately, there\u2019s more than just technical attributes to this film. Three magnificent and powerful performances from Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, carry the whole thing to safe harbor.\r\n\r\nThese three actresses deserve every single nomination they got so far. Colman delivers both a hilarious and emotionally heavy display, as Anne. An incredibly fragile Queen with a shockingly traumatic past, whose love and affection is being fought for between Abigail and Sarah. Most of the laughs this movie gives are through Anne and her petty behavior towards her servants. Colman delivers her body and soul to her role, adding yet another fantastic performance to her splendid career. Weisz is just flawless. Sarah\u2018s arc is Abigail\u2018s opposite in almost every way, and Rachel is remarkably sharp. She doesn\u2019t really have a definite shining moment like Stone or Colman have, but it\u2019s a consistent and robust display from an actress who needed a return to the spotlight.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it\u2019s Emma Stone who shines through with an unbelievable range of emotions and expressions. Her performance in La La Land is great, but as Abigail she is outstanding! She handles her character\u2019s personality change with an impeccable transition regarding her acting and the only reason why she\u2019s probably not getting the Oscar win, is due to the campaign supporting Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk). Abigail is the character that moves the plot forward by trying to steal Sarah\u2018s place near the Queen. Her intelligent and manipulative moves are extremely captivating, as well as her will to gain Anne\u2018s love.\r\n\r\nYorgos Lanthimos knows his craft and his weird yet unparalleled style is something that will surely deliver even more divisive and confusing films in the future. From the camera angles to his methods of storytelling, he\u2019s one hell of a director-writer-producer! Technically, The Favourite is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the last year. The impressive production and set design plus the addictive score definitely raise the film, but the costume design tells a whole story through what the characters dress during the whole runtime. The screenplay is remarkably-written, filled with complex dialogues and several twists and turns, which lead our characters through eventful arcs. \r\n\r\nOlivia Colman and Rachel Weisz deliver compelling performances, but Emma Stone is in another level. Her range is mind-boggling, and she carries a big responsibility by portraying the character who changes the whole story. Nevertheless, the movie feels a bit too long, and the story drops its interest levels during the transition from the second to the third act. Basically, I\u2019ll put it like this: if you\u2019re just a regular audience member who only goes to the theater to eat popcorn while being entertained, The Favourite isn\u2019t going to make you eat your whole bucket; if you watch films through a more in-depth look, then you\u2019ll be as marveled as I was by the end of it.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "Hugely entertaining film from start to finish, with amazing performances from the three lead women. Emma Stone proves that once again she's not just a pretty face as the conniving and troubled Abigail, Rachel Weisz is always on form as the controlling and vindictive Sarah and Olivia Coleman deserved the Oscar as the childish and sickly Queen Anne. Nicholas Hoult's foppish rogue Harley steals every scene he is in.\r\n\r\nYorgos Lanthimos once again has made a beautifully shot film using  mostly natural light. I can't overstate that this film looks gorgeous. Many times over I thought of Barry Lyndon, but with tonnes of humour, foul language, and no Ryan O'Neal to destroy the soul of the film.\r\n\r\nI originally gave this 9/10 because I didn't like the use of fish-eye lens, but I couldn't stop thinking of how much I enjoyed it so I bumped it up to 10.\r\n\r\nBest film I have seen in a very long time.",

It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy._\r\n\r\n- Olivia Colman; \"_The Favourite_ Blows Up Gender Politics With the Year's Most Outrageous Love Triangle\" (Tatiana Siegel); _The Hollywood Reporter_ (November 14, 2018)\r\n\r\n_The Favourite_, the seventh feature from Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. Imagine, if you will, a narrative combining Joseph L. Mankiewicz's _All About Eve_ (1950), Ingmar Bergman's _Viskningar och rop_ (1975), and Mark Waters's _Mean Girls_ (2004) filtered through the aesthetic sensibilities of Stanley Kubrick's _Barry Lyndon_ (1975), Peter Greenaway's _The Draughtsman's Contract_ (1992), and Stephen Frears's _Dangerous Liaisons_ (1988), topped off with a dash of Luis Bu\u00f1uel at his most socially satirical, and you'll be some way towards imagining this bizarre and uncategorisable film from a director with as unique and distinctive a voice as you're likely to find in world cinema. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power \u2013 it's all of these and yet none of them. I haven't seen Lanthimos's first two films, _O kalyteros mou filos_ (2001) and _Kinetta_ (2005), but I adored _Kynodontas_ (2009), as difficult as it was to watch. I was a little indifferent to _Alpeis_ (2011), but I loved _The Lobster_ (2015), his blackest comedy thus far. His last film, however, _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_ (2017) did very little for me, as I felt it offered nothing we hadn't seen in his previous work. So I came to _The Favourite_ wanting to like it, but ready to dislike it. And I find myself somewhere in the middle. On the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill-defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nEngland, 1708. Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising Olivia Colman) has been on the throne for six years, with Great Britain finding itself enmeshed in the War of the Spanish Succession. In poor health, Anne has little interest in politics, with the real power lying with her friend, adviser, and secret lover Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy Rachel Weisz). Sarah and Prime Minister Sidney Godolphin (James Smith) plan to finance the war effort by doubling property taxes, but are opposed by the leader of the opposition \u2013 Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford (Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, Sarah's impoverished younger cousin, Abigail Hill (Emma Stone, charting a course from doe-eyed _ing\u00e9nue_ to vicious Machiavellian _intrigant_), arrives at Court looking for work. Sarah secures her a position as a scullery maid, but when Abigail learns that Anne is suffering from gout, she uses a herbal remedy on the sleeping Queen without asking permission. Sarah has her whipped for her presumption, but Anne sees a noticeable improvement in her condition, and by way of apology, Sarah gives Abigail a position closer to the Queen. With Harley hoping to use Abigail as a spy to find out what Sarah is planning, and Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn), a foppish courtier, attempting to woo her, Abigail must quickly adapt to courtly life. Learning of the lesbian relationship between Anne and Sarah, Abigail begins to ingratiate herself with the Queen, leading to a bitter contest between herself and Sarah, as each attempt to establish themselves as Anne's favourite.\r\n\r\n_The Favourite_ is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor Efthymis Filippou wrote. Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos and his screenwriters Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara are relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing and frequently anachronistic dialogue). For example, there's no reference to the Glorious Revolution (1688), which saw James II, the last Catholic monarch of England, overthrown; or to the Treaty of Union (1707), which formally brought the state of Great Britain into existence. Similarly, it is never mentioned that Anne was the last Stuart monarch or that Abigail was appointed Keeper of the Privy Purse in 1711. The nature of the political antagonism between the Tories and the Whigs, although often referred to and occasionally witnessed, is kept vague, with little in the way of an historical frame of reference. For example, the film never addresses the fact that Godolphin and Harley were both Tories, with Godolphin heading an administration dominated by leading Whigs (the Whig Junto), and Harley leading a coalition of Country Whigs and Tories in opposition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's no evidence whatsoever that Anne and Sarah were lovers. On the contrary, Sarah is known to have found lesbianism abhorrent, commissioning the politician Arthur Maynwaring to write scurrilous poems about Abigail which intimated that she might be gay. Additionally, Anne was devoted to her husband, Prince George of Denmark, who doesn't even warrant a mention, let alone an appearance, despite being alive and well at the time of Abigail's arrival at Court. However, it's also important to note that the film makes no claim to be a history lecture. This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.\r\n\r\nBut although it may not be historically accurate, it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar _Weltanschauung_ omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from _The Lobster_ and _Sacred Deer_, but everything else you'd expect is here \u2013 the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist sense of humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score, which mixes pieces by Purcell, Vivaldi, Handel, and Bach with more contemporary work from the likes of Olivier Messiaen, Luc Ferrari, and Anna Meredith, whilst the closing credits feature Elton John's \"Skyline Pigeon\" (really). Similarly, whilst _The Lobster_ was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, _The Favourite_ is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a _f\u00eate galante_ painting, so meticulously integrated are the costume design by Sandy Powell (_Interview with the Vampire_; _Shakespeare in Love_; _Carol_), the production design by Fiona Crombie (_Snowtown_; _Truth_; _Mary Magdalene_), and the cinematography by Robbie Ryan (_Fish Tank_; _Philomena_; _American Honey_). Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design. For example, speaking to _Entertainment Weekly_, Powell says of Abigail and her rise to a position of influence,\r\n\r\n> _I wanted to give her that vulgarity of the_ nouveau riche_, and her dresses get a little bolder and showier. There's more pattern involved and there are black-and-white stripes. I wanted her to stand out from everybody else as trying too hard._\r\n\r\nIn a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds. The occasional use of black-and-white stripes is also worth mentioning, as it subliminally intimates that the characters are imprisoned, not so much by their physical _milieu_, but rather within the hypocrisy, pettiness, and forced politeness of the Royal Court.\r\n\r\nOf Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As Ryan explains to _Deadline_,\r\n\r\n> _by the nature of being able to see everything in front of you, you then get a sense that the characters are almost imprisoned in the location. Even though they have all this luxury and power, they are a little bit isolated in this world. By showing you the whole room and also isolating the character in a small space you get a feeling of no escape._\r\n\r\nAs with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a deeply tragic figure too na\u00efve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail, something encapsulated brilliantly in the haunting last shot. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.\r\n\r\nWeisz and Stone are also both excellent. Weisz plays Sarah as a clinical manipulator, highly intelligent and relatively emotionless, whereas Stone's Abigail grows from a guileless chambermaid to a vindictive Janus-faced usurper. However, even at her most outrageous, there remains always something of the innocent girl we met earlier in the film.\r\n\r\nThe film's most salient theme, one could argue its very _raison d'\u00eatre_, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the only two male characters of any significance (Godolphin and Harley) are both portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Indeed, men in general are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped \u2013 with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. Speaking to _Entertainment Weekly_, Powell explains that Lanthimos wanted the women to have natural hair and light makeup, and the men to wear gaudy makeup and ridiculous wigs;\r\n\r\n> _normally films are filled with men, and the women are the decoration in the background, and I've done many of those, so it was quite nice for it to be reversed this time where the women are the centre of the film and the men are the decoration in the background._\r\n\r\nSimilarly, speaking to the _Hollywood Reporter_, Weisz explains,\r\n\r\n> _what's interesting to me is that the men in_ The Favourite _are wearing lots of makeup and blusher and lipstick and high heels. That they're peripheral characters who are slightly ridiculous. They're an afterthought. That may not be unusual in life, but it's unusual to see in films._\r\n\r\nHowever, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-premi\u00e8re press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained,\r\n\r\n> _what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings._\r\n\r\nThe preening and pettiness of the men, of course, is purposely overdone (Harley proclaims at one point that \"_a man must look pretty_\"), creating a _milieu_ where it is men, not women, who tend to be judged by their appearance, objectified, and used. Just look at the hilarious scene where Abigail coldly gives Masham a hand-job as she ruminates about more important matters \u2013 once she has gotten what she wants from him (his hand in marriage), she is no longer interested in him whatsoever, a direct reversal of traditional filmic gender roles, where it is usually men who use women. Men, in _The Favourite_, are utterly disposable.\r\n\r\nAs regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work \u2013 cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his _oeuvre_, especially when compared to _Sacred Deer_, I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, but are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with _Sacred Deer_ was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of _The Favourite_, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.\r\n\r\n_The Favourite_ will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant-Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, _The Favourite_ offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a _milieu_ of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.",
            "Some wounds do not close; I have many such. One just walks around with them and sometimes one can feel them filling with blood. \r\n\r\nThe Favourite is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. It stars Olivia Colman, Rachael Weisz, Emma Stone, Faye Daveney, James Smith, Mark Gatiss, Willem Dalby and Nicholas Hoult.     \r\n\r\nIn early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne (Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah (Weisz), governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail (Stone), arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. \r\n\r\nA critical darling with awards and nominations to match, The Favourite, to me at least, is something of an acquired taste. Firstly it should be noted that as a history lesson it's pure bunkum, so much so I wondered if Lanthimos is actually Mel Gibson. Though to be fair to Lanthimos, he never hid from the fact he and his writers were pretty much making it up for entertainment purpose.\r\n\r\nThe craft on show is top level, with three high quality lead lady performances giving their all for the director. Lanthimos also has some nifty camera tricks up his sleeve, it's clear that this is a talent to follow for those so inclined to his off kilter type of film making. Helps, too, that the costuming and set designs are also from the top draw. It's hard to fault from a production standpoint.\r\n\r\nNarratively the pic is pulsing with parliamentary politics that blends with royal shenanigans. Yet ultimately the prime concern is about the battle for Queen Anne's soul between Sarah and Abigail. This consistently remains fascinating, even as Lanthimos continues to sex things up and pitches black comedy alongside the tragic thrum at the core. \r\n\r\nIt's an odd mix of a film that I personally don't think works as a whole, and with the finale a crushing disappointment, it leaves one in awe and yet also unsatisfied. 7/10",
            "Queen Anne was one of the few British monarchs still to have had her story committed to film and this was the Oscar winning result. Olivia Coleman stands out as the cantankerous and temperamental last of the Stuart's to reign; but otherwise the performances fall rather flat. The rivalry - and sometimes pretty vulgar visualisation of it - between Abigail & Sarah Churchill doesn't quite work for me and the foppish Nicholas Hoult is a parody of something from \"Blackadder\". It moves along quite sharpishly, and the craft skills behind it all are second to none, but I can't help feel that the subject matter - and the triplet of three strong women in leading roles earned it more attention that the film actually merited."

            "My immediate response as soon as this finished was \"MASTERPIECE.\" Lanthimos is back to _Dogtooth_-level craziness with this film and I couldn't be happier. _The Lobster_ was a favourite of mine in 2016, but something about this one's hopelessness drew me in more - odd, I know. Lanthimos' films have characters stuck in dead end situations where they are able to make a choice, but the results of the options are bad and worse. It's a dour story and the film is relentlessly unsettling, but this is what I've come to expect and want out of this Greek maestro.\r\n\r\nSacred Deer is a suburban Greek tragedy that draws inspiration from Euripides\u2019 _Iphigenia in Aulis_ - a character even mentions this title in a key scene - and it plays out both as you'd imagine and with great shock and originality. Lanthimos and his writing partner Efthymis Filippou may just be my favourite writing team working today - they haven't let me down yet.\r\n\r\nThe cast is spectacular here with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell in top form bringing the odd words of Lanthimos and Filippou to life - albeit a very, very strange life. Farrell, having worked with Lanthimos on The Lobster, had nothing but high praise for the director during tonight's Q&A after the screening of the film. He even said they were planning another project to work on together. He's slowly becoming a muse and their relationship is turning into a DiCaprio-Scorsese type partnership (except I look forward to these way, way more).\r\n\r\nThe audience I was in had a hard time with this film - there was audible shock and disgust during the film and the applause as it ended was slight. I think people were genuinely scandalized by this one and that makes me like it even more. Keep shocking audiences, Lanthimos, you Greek bastard. I'll be in line every single time!",
            "I am a big fan of some of Yorgos Lanthimos' earlier work, so _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_, which I had been told in no uncertain terms would be a straight up horror movie, was well and truly on the agenda for 2017. Unfortunately, I found that not only was _Sacred Deer_ not at all a horror, but more importantly that it lacked the dark whimsy of something truly odd, like the director's previous film, _Lobster_. Instead it opts for an outright uncomfortable tone. The world is real, boringly so, and it is only the characters who seem unbelievable. Which is a 180 on the sort of absurdism I usually gravitate towards. That said, _Sacred Deer_ still contains some beautiful cinematography, and a couple of the most genuine laugh-out-loud moments I've seen in a movie all year.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
            "Finally got the chance to see this via Amazon.\n\nDogtooth and The Lobster (from the same Greek director, who I must admit has a keen sense of storytelling) did not impress me at all. Very interesting ideas; atrocious presentations. Dogtooth was indecipherable and The Lobster is cruel, ugly, and not humorous in any fashion (I've no idea why it's billed as a black comedy.)\n\nHowever, this latest film is entertaining to me despite it's grim and inky-black nature (based on the ancient Greek play, which is where the title is loosely derived from.) Perhaps it's a bit more straight-forward despite its cryptic nature, a bit more involved in some form of reality we can recognize and less inference as to what the hey is really happening. But I sure watched it w/ more interest than The Lobster (I've no interest in the director's film prior to that one.)\n\nA successful heart surgeon (w/ a past history of alcoholism, sober for some time at present) is shown to have an uneasy alliance w/ the teenaged son of a patient who died on the operating table. It's clear the boy has some hold over this surgeon, who seems eager to please him but his heart's not into it (no pun intended.)\n\nThe boy's true intentions are revealed as events move forward; the surgeon's wife and two children (a few years apart, both intelligent in their own ways) are placed in grave danger as well as dear old Dad, and to reveal just how would spoil it for first-time viewers.\n\nThe camera-work here is impeccable, as are the jarring soundscapes, found-sounds, and industrial noise which makes for harrowing listening. The actor playing Martin, the teenaged oddball w/ a shared secret, is riveting to watch in a well-suited role. \n\nSacred Deer isn't so much a horror-film as a drama w/ strong elements of dream-like reality, awkward young romance, and assorted chills and cold calculated sex-scenes involving \"playing dead\" and \"the other.\"\n\nMy biggest complaints would be as before w/ this director's work: everyone speaks their lines as if hearing them through an ear-piece to parrot back, which makes the cast seem rather stilted and robotic. This director favors a weird tangent of \"Mamet-speak.\"\n\nThe ending is about what you'd expect, following the matter-of-fact discussions which precede it. Up until that point Sacred Deer does a pretty good job keeping us wondering what will happen next, where will things lead, what is that kid's gift and whereupon was it bestowed; unfortunately the outcome isn't as entrancing or unexpected as I'd hoped.\n\nBut overall worth my time to watch. Considering how disappointed I was by the previous films by the director I'd watched (great reviews, all of which confounded and puzzled me) this film was much less of a bore and a chore to watch. A pleasant, unpleasant surprise indeed.",
            "**What a shame this could have been excellent**\r\n\r\nThis film depicts the life of upper class people as we like to imagine it, and brilliantly so. The medical doctors couple have it all figured out, speak in complete sentences and are firm and polite. The house is gorgeous, the children are smart and well behaved. The setting of the story as a whole is very well done, believable and with great actors to boot.\r\n\r\nThe score is not so great. At times we have experimental \"music\" that just annoys and does nothing for the mood, but the visuals are exciting to watch, we have interesting camera angles, no shaking and clever zooms and motion.\r\n\r\nThe pace is slow, yet \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" is never boring. There is always a plot twist which is explored after, things take their time but rightfully so.\r\n\r\nWhy the relatively detailed review for a 1.5 star rating? The problem is that the climax is just a huge letdown. The audience can't help themselves but wonder what is going on, guessing on the crime the apparently genius 16 year old villain commits. It is never explained. The makers thought it would be enough to have the bad guy win. It is not enough.\r\n\r\nIn the end everything good about the movie was negated by breaking the suspension of disbelief in a petty way, just ending the movie.\r\n\r\nEven \"The Leftovers\" explained its phenomenon, and that show did not need to. There the mystery was the premise for character development, here the mystery is a tool to keep the viewer's attention.\r\n\r\nI'd like to give less than 1.5 stars, because of how cheated I feel and because of the waste of talent and production value. But I'm sure there are people who love this and people who will learn from this.\r\n\r\n18 December 2017\r\n\r\nI am migrating my reviews from a different site which has become simply garbage. TMDB looks awesome and I look forward to be a part of it.",
            "I found this to be one of the better Yorgos Lanthimos films, but I just cannot get behind his writing style. The stories he delivers are incredibly unique and I want to like them so much more than I actually do. Despite those drawbacks, _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_ was a mind-bending movie that threw me for a loop. The performances were great all around, as they should be with a star-studded cast featuring Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, and Barry Keoghan. The plot was incredibly twisted and dark. I enjoyed this film, but much like Lobster, and really wish there was a more modern spin on the writing instead of the short choppy and somewhat awkward framing that Lanthimos is known for.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _65%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_",
            "This film managed to keep me fully engaged. I watched it at 1.0 speed, which has been challenging for me lately. The plot was so thrilling, but after it ended, I had this feeling of uncertainty. Perhaps I did not realize something, or maybe there was a hidden reason behind everything that was happening. I was left with unanswered questions. However, as I read other reviews, I started to realize that this was my first time watching a film by Yorgos Lanthimos, and I did not fully catch up to his style. By the way, I discovered this film through Barry Keoghan, and he did not disappoint. My next stop is \"The Lobster\" as you all love it so much."

            "> **_Review on Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nThis indie sci-fi thriller Vivarium from Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is many things, one definitely being quite the head-scratcher. Not because of it being an intellectually challenging story, or one that is laced with twists and turns to create an unpredictable viewing, but a film that delivers a narratives so peculiar that it is like something you've never seen before. Take this with a pinch of salt, as there's certainly aspects which don't make the landing of such an ambitious plot, but let it also be known that Vivarium contains some impressions visual and narrative storytelling, enough to forgive some of the mid-act waffle that cripples the films momentum.\r\n\r\nFinnegan gets the ball rolling with power, keeping the story taught enough that we are thrown straight into the mystery early doors. This works extremely well as the tension begins to bubble within the first ten minute mark. The performances here from our main cast member already begin to show their brilliance, especially Jonathon Aris who sets a chilling foreshadowing tone with his appropriately eerie character Martin. The small (yet effective) amount of screen time we have with Martin is enough to set the tone, and we, like Tom and Gemma are forced to endure something that is so ominously intense that it leaves a lingering sense of dread.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this soon begins to simmer once Finnegan establishes the plot in its whole, and realisation settles on the simple fact that, after the 30 minute mark, there really isn't much else for the story to go. Yes the labyrinth maze of suburbia is strangely terrifying, and the strenuous repetition is effective, but after 15 minutes of having the child introduced, Vivarium begins to fall flat, and grow increasingly more stale up until after the sixty minutes in. The fantastic Poots and Eisenberg, and the deadpan humour do prevent this film from becoming a little too one-note, but this doesn't exuse more than a few scenes that will be a task to sit through, even in these current homebound world we are living in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a glimmer of brilliance in Finnegan's choice of release here, as what our main couple are enduring is poetically reflective of the life we are living in this mad pandemic virus. I found myself identifying with the irritated attitude our characters develop, and sympathised with them when their child (the boy) was well deserving of a slap. Vivarium is intelligently relative right now, and can definitely be perceived as as Finnegan holding a mirror up to the idealistic yet treacherous concept of what makes the perfect home, and the urge to be the perfect family.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there's so much underlying aspects of Vivarium that are so incredibly reflective of the inevitable repetition that comes once a spunky couple are weighed down by family life, securing their \"ideal\" home and tolerating each others impurities under the same roof constantly. Finnegan exposes the dangers of the nuclear family here, and forces us to endure it too, warts and all. We even get those little moments in which Tom consistently chips away, digging a whole, not to be talked to, helped or interrupted by Gemma, who becomes a slave to ensuring nothing but contentment for their boy. This moment is humourous with a dark sting, and will be reflective of reality to many, but to those inside Vivarium is nothing but a nightmarish loop.\r\n\r\nThis distorted utopia Finnegan creates is what's most effective, orchestrated by a Burton-esque palette that is as gorgeous as it is hauntingly off-kilter. The early 80's, Romero's Day of the \r\n\r\nDead-like synth is undeniably effective, and carries the tension through to the final act, which although doesn't hit a payoff point that excuses the slow middle act, does add to the bankers reality Finnegan has crafted, and highlights the eeriness established from the beginning. While Vivarium does lose a tone of momentum when it hits the mid-way point, by the time it reaches its end, I can't shake the distinct feeling of unease I had to endure for over eighty minutes, and I can't deny that a film like this was an experience I have quite been exposed to before. I have been feeling really under the weather these past few days, and let's just say this only made me feel worse. Great job, I guess?\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nVivarium is a simplistically disturbing suburban nightmare with a captivating story and little room for growth. Enduring its drab middle act may prove tricky, but once Finnegan blows the dust of the eerie intensity established from the beginning, you'll find there is much to be desired with this unsettling little indie-sci-fi thriller.",
            "Amazing watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nImogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg (both from \"The Art of Self Defense\") are amazing in their roles as an abducted couple force to raise a child.\r\n\r\nThis is an amazing premise (see \"Solar Opposites\" for something similar), and one that is extremely hard to discuss without spoilers. This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is \"adoption of a strange child\" trope, there is a \"troubled couple\" trope, there is even a mystery trope.\r\n\r\nI'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different \"Twilight Zone\" episodes.\r\n\r\nThe production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through.",
            "Sci-fi thriller, just not _\"on the edge of sit\"_ type. Lorcan Finnegan remakes his short film **Foxes** and adds a life message to it.",
            "It's a movie whose premise had promise but was never thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nI read the generally high praise in the reviews for this movie and admittedly, I was fooled. I'm convinced that at least the individual here who likened part of its premise to the animated series, \"Solar Opposites,\" while not being entirely off the mark, neglected to mention that unlike Solar Opposites, there is no payoff with Vivarium. Unlike Solar Opposites, we don't know why Vivarium exists. We don't know why people are expected to raise these mysterious hominids. We don't know what their purpose is, other than to entrap first home buyers, like some kind of otherworldly predatory lender. Is it a euphemism for unscrupulous property developers? Who knows?\r\n\r\nOnly thing I know is that by the end of it all, I felt totally ripped off. At around 90 minutes, it was 60 minutes too long. It's not even something that I can suggest is open to much interpretation.\r\n\r\nIf you just need something playing in the background while you're performing other work at home, even then it may be a stretch but it certainly doesn't deserve much better.",
            "Vivarium was eerie and creepy, and definitely a movie that will mess with your head, albeit probably in ways other than you anticipated. You'll be tricked in the beginning into believing this movie is actually a sociological observation of the slow and robotic death of suburban life: you and your nuclear family settle into middle class conformity in a large, seemingly endless design of mazes and hedges, condemned to repeat the endless cycle of home, school (or work), home, sleep, rinse and repeat. And it certainly gives one those unsettling vibes, especially when the creepy box with the build-a-baby arrives at their prison doorsteps.\r\n\r\nRather, this is something else entirely. While it does well maintaining that nearly subtle sense of wrongness, of something being terribly just _off_, in the end, you may find yourself somewhat disappointed, as it is at this precise moment the film becomes like every other movie of its kind out there. Quite possibly, it is the end that is the most disturbing, for it seems to insinuate that humanity is as disposable as livestock.",
            "A young couple go to an estate agent to seek out their dream home. They encounter the almost robotic \"Martin\" who offers to show them their ideal residence - and so off go Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg to inspect. They discover a typical detached house in the suburbs, surrounded by identical homes that leave them a bit cold. When their guide disappears, they decide to go home - except; they are caught in a labyrinthine network of streets that always brings them back to \"No. 9\". Soon, a baby in a box arrives and their happiness ought to be complete - except they have no other human contact and so slowly, but surely, start to go a bid mad. The kid has an infuriating habit of screaming loudly when he doesn't get what he wants - and I felt much like screaming myself as the cyclical pointlessness of this really dreary film did start to get on my nerves. Perhaps Lorcan Finnegan intended the potency of the sterility of the whole thing to engender a feeling of irritation from his audience; if he did then top marks. Otherwise, this is a total waste of the talents of two actors who could have found better ways to help us pass 100 minutes.",
            "\"Vivarium\" is one of those movies that pulls you in with an interesting concept but leaves you questioning everything, especially the choices the characters make. The story follows a couple who find themselves trapped in a seemingly endless suburban neighborhood, forced into a bizarre and unsettling routine. The mystery keeps you engaged, but the characters\u2019 decisions often feel frustrating. Not in a \"bad script\" way, but in a way that makes you wonder if they were written to be this passive on purpose. The pacing leans toward slow-burn horror, relying more on psychological unease than traditional scares.\r\n\r\nThe directing does a solid job of maintaining tension, making the whole thing feel claustrophobic and surreal. The cinematography enhances this with sterile, repetitive visuals that emphasize the artificiality of their world. Acting-wise, Imogen Poots delivers a strong performance, while Jesse Eisenberg brings his usual style, which sometimes works but occasionally feels forced. The real standout is the child actor, his unsettling presence adds a lot to the film\u2019s eerie atmosphere. There\u2019s a lot of subtlety in how he moves and reacts, making you wonder whether his voice was altered or dubbed over in post.\r\n\r\nThe script keeps things cryptic, and while that works for the tone, it also leaves some moments feeling underdeveloped. The lack of clear explanations may frustrate some viewers, but it\u2019s clear that the movie is more about the experience than the answers. The sound design plays a big role in the tension, using unsettling audio cues to make certain scenes even more uncomfortable. Overall, Vivarium is a strange, thought-provoking film that raises more questions than it answers. If you like psychological horror with a heavy dose of surrealism, it\u2019s worth a watch. Just don\u2019t expect everything to make sense."

            "**_An impressive eco-thriller that could do with more clearly delineated characters_**\r\n\r\n>_It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life._\r\n\r\n- Rachel Carson; _The Sea Around Us_ (1951)\r\n\r\n>_From the ocean came a roar of passions that seemed to have broken through all barriers: 'We must procreate and multiply! We must exhaust all the powers of lust!' The waves glowed like lava, and I imagined I could see multitudes of living beings \u2013 algae, whales, sea monsters \u2013 revelling in an orgy, from the surface to_ _the bottom of the sea. Immortality was the law here._\r\n\r\n- Isaac Bashevis Singer; \"Hanka\"; from _Passions and Other Stories_ (1975)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from writer/director Neasa Hardiman, _Sea Fever_ examines such issues as humanity's disregard for the size of our ecological footprint, the knee-jerk argument that if something hitherto unknown can't be exploited for profit then it should be destroyed, and Mankind's utter insignificance in the face of the wonders of nature. Heavily influenced by David Cronenberg's body horror films, Ridley Scott's _Alien_ (1979), and John Carpenter's _The Thing_ (1982), it could do with some refinement, especially in terms of characterisation, and the _d\u00e9nouement_ is a little anticlimactic, but Hardiman gets the atmosphere spot on, and overall, this is an impressive debut.\r\n\r\nSiobh\u00e1n (Hermione Corfield with a gorgeous head of red hair and a decent Irish accent) is an all-work-and-no-play doctoral student studying marine biology, specifically anomalous ecological patterns. A socially awkward introvert, she's not at all happy with she's told that she needs to get practical experience outside the lab and so her professor has organised for her to join a fishing boat and monitor their haul. The boat in question, the _Niamh Chinn-\u00d3ir_, is owned by Freya (Connie Nielsen) and captained by her husband Gerard (Dougray Scott), but it hasn't been doing too well recently and money is tight. However, Gerard has been tracking a huge shoal of fish and believes their luck is about to change. Meanwhile, Siobh\u00e1n gets to know the crew; Ciara (the always spectacular Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9), her son Johnny (Jack Hickey), genius engineer Omid (Ardalan Esmaili), and the baby of the group, Sudi (Elie Bouakaze). Upon sailing, Gerard sees that the shoal has moved into an exclusion zone, but without telling anyone, he too enters the zone. No sooner has he done so when the _Niamh_ hits something and becomes entangled. Investigating the collision, Siobh\u00e1n is stunned to see huge bioluminescent tentacles arising from the deep and attached to the hull. Back on board, she's thrilled to announce they may have encountered a creature unknown to science, but when it becomes apparent that the tentacles are secreting dangerous microscopic parasites onto the _Niamh_, the crew find themselves in a fight for survival, where their greatest enemy is one another.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fhianna\u00edocht_ [Fenian Cycle] of Irish mythology, Niamh Chinn \u00d3ir [Niamh of the Golden Hair] is the daughter of Manann\u00e1n mac Lir, king of the Otherworld, T\u00edr na n\u00d3g [Land of the Young]. Upon falling in love with Ois\u00edn, son of Fionn mac Cumhaill, Niamh returns with him to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, where they spend three happy years, although in the real world, 300 years have passed. Wanting to see his homeland again, Ois\u00edn persuades Niamh to let him return to Ireland. She gives him her horse, \u00c9nbarr, but warns him not to dismount and touch the soil or the spell of youth from T\u00edr na n\u00d3g will be broken. After finding his childhood home on _Cnoc Al\u00faine_ desolate, he is helping some men move a large stone when he falls from \u00c9nbarr and immediately turns into an old man. Before he dies, Ois\u00edn encounters Saint P\u00e1draig, telling him the stories of the _fianna_. The relevance for _Sea Fever_ is fairly obvious; the exclusion zone is T\u00edr na n\u00d3g and the _Niamh_ is Ois\u00edn, going somewhere it shouldn't be, a place which will fundamentally change it. The possibility of the Niamh returning to Ireland carrying an infection correlates with Ois\u00edn being 'infected' with age if he touches the soil of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn a post-screening Q&A with Hardiman at the film's Irish premi\u00e8re, she specifically said that one of the main impetuses behind the story was to offer a corrective for films which demonise or are critical of the scientific method, to challenge narratives which \"_depict the scientific method as being cut-off, antisocial, self-important, and irrelevant_\". In this sense, there's a lot more hard real-world science than you might expect \u2013 from details of Siobh\u00e1n's research and her explanations of marine biology, biodiversity, and anomalous patterns to some fairly detailed discussions of the possible biochemistry of the creature that ensnares the _Niamh_, hypotheses as to why it behaves the way it does, and detailed depictions of how the parasites enter and exit the bloodstream (how they exit is not for the faint at heart). In the latter half of the film, a lot of time is given over to discussions of whether the _Niamh_ should head back to Ireland, with Siobh\u00e1n trying to make the others understand the devastating ramifications that could result from introducing the parasites into a population centre. All of this doesn't quite position the film in the realm of science-fact, but it certainly helps to lend the narrative a stronger sense of real-world verisimilitude.\r\n\r\nScience is also important thematically insofar as one of the main issues explored is that the creature may not be acting aggressively in attaching to the _Niamh_; it's simply trying to survive, and even the parasites aren't a form of attack. In this way, Hardiman refuses to demonise the creature, and from the moment of its discovery, Siobh\u00e1n consistently argues that the crew must protect it, which is not what you expect from this type of film. On the other hand, Gerard sees it in more black and white terms; initially as something to be used for profit, and later as something to be destroyed \u2013 capitalism at its finest. There are no real villains as such, but on a sliding moral scale, the creature is above several of the human characters.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, there's a merciful absence of jump scares and, apart from one scene, there's very little gore. Instead, the film's horror elements are based more in the intricate sound design, Ray Ball's production design, and Ruair\u00ed O'Brien's cinematography. The three work in tandem to make it impossible for the viewer to ever forget that we're on a ship isolated at sea \u2013 from the constant creaking and sound of lapping water to the claustrophobic quarters (the _Niamh_ is so small, it only has four beds) to the handheld and often dimly lit photography that imbues every shadow with a sense of the unknown. Indeed, as was the _USCSS Nostromo_ in _Alien_ and U.S. Outpost 31 in _The Thing_, the rusty and battered _Niamh_ (a vessel which has clearly seen better days) is very much a character in _Sea Fever_, and its aesthetic design is pivotal in allowing Hardiman to achieve a sense of psychological unease.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the most significant is that even given the small cast, there isn't a huge amount of character differentiation. Even Siobh\u00e1n is never really developed, whilst the _Niamh_'s crew are largely interchangeable. One of the reasons films like _Alien_ and _The Thing_ are considered classics is because of how good the character individualisation is \u2013 every person in both of those films is a distinct individual with an interiority and a clearly defined set of character traits that sets him or her apart from the others; pick any character, and you'll be able to talk about who that character is as a person, from the take-charge and rational Dallas (Tom Skerritt) to the reactionary Parker (Yaphet Kotto) in _Alien_, from the by-the-book and eerily calm Garry (Donald Moffat) to the hot-headed Childs (Keith David) in _The Thing_. Their traits aren't painted in minutiae, but they are painted in strokes clearly differentiated from the others. A failure to recreate this is one of the main reasons that Scott's _Prometheus_ (2012) is such a pile of tripe wherein no one is differentiated from anyone else and no one acts consistently because none of them have dominant character traits. _Sea Fever_'s script is a lot better than that rubbish, but it's still very light on individualisation, which makes it harder to care about these people, which makes them feel expendable, a potential death sentence for a film of this nature. Thankfully, it doesn't come to that here, but with just a little more work on the screenplay, the whole film could really have been elevated into something truly special. Another small gripe I have is that the conclusion is pretty anticlimactic; it works very well thematically, but it's a bit weak in terms of drama or tension, and it feels somewhat rushed.\r\n\r\nMixing body-horror with elements of a creature-feature garnished with some eco-friendly themes, _Sea Fever_ is a very enjoyable film and an impressive debut feature. Although its broader genre beats offer nothing we haven't seen before, it still manages to feel like its own thing with its own things to say. It could do with a better balance in terms of the plot/characterisation ratio, but the unexpected focus on science and ecological themes mean it rises above the monster movie clich\u00e9s you might expect, which should help it to stand out in a crowded field.",
            "It has a promising plot but somehow it lacked substance, especially towards the end of the film. Somehow I was expecting a conclusion to the entire \u201cmonster\u201d situation, but then it was left unattended.\r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching the film though. Would I watch it again? No. Would I make my friends watch it? Possibly.",
            "Ultimately, while it gets a boost of inadvertent timeliness from the COVID-19 climate of pandemic paranoia, face-touching phobia and quarantined cabin fever, 'Sea Fever' is a fairly straightforward, even generic, blue-collar-workers-in-peril thriller.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-sea-fever-paranoia-parasitic-plagues-and-pandemic-horror",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's the first thing I've watched recently that didn't feel like they could (and should) shave an hour off of it. A nice, light watch that had a unique concept and a likable cast. I agree with others that the eye popping scene was about as intense as it got, with everyone else dying in fairly lackluster ways. I'm not normally one to say up the gore, but a bit more would have made the second half feel more intense and urgent.\r\n\r\nI also couldn't help but find it amusingly relevant to the current world \"situation\" with Siobh\u00e1n urging everyone to quarantine themselves and think about the greater good over themselves. If she only knew what an impossible task that is.",
            "Obviously done on a shoestring budget, this is actually quite an interesting little sci-fi/horror mystery. It all centres around the crew of a stranded trawler who come to realise that there is a malevolent beastie that has found it's way into their water supply after their boat strayed into a restricted area. Luckily \"Siobh\u00e1n\" (Hermione Corfield) has some scientific skills and plans a way to stop this lethal parasite from killing (rather messily) not just the people on the boat, but anyone they come into contact to. Rather prudently, it does not try to blow us away with fancy special effects. The use of light on the water and some basic microbe imagery conjures enough just enough sense of menace to keep the plot interesting; as do the efforts from a confident Corfield alongside Dag Malmberg and Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 - and Jack Hickey is quite easy on the eye, too! The script is nobody's finest work, and it is a mite too long - but it delivers well enough within it's limitations and kills 90 minutes on the television fine."

            "**_Not really the Famine film we were promised, but still a decent thriller_**\r\n\r\n> _A mother's heart was marble-clad, her eye was fierce and wild,/A hungry Demon lurked therein, while gazing on her child./The mother-love was warm and true; the Want was long withstood -/Strength failed at last; she gorged the flesh - the offspring of her blood._\r\n\r\n- Anonymous; \"Thanatos, 1849\"\r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie \u2013 I fully expected to hate _Black '47_. The trailer was awful, making it look like a generic action flick; several colleagues saw the screening at ADIFF earlier in the year and were decidedly unimpressed; I thought most of the film was in English, which rubbed me up the wrong way altogether. Mainly though, I was just fulfilling my God-given right as an Irish person \u2013 being cankerous for no earthly reason whatsoever. However, because I was expecting to hate it, when I discovered, much to my chagrin, that it's actually quite good, it led to me thoroughly enjoying it. Colour me humbled. Easily the most hyped and anticipated Irish film of the last decade or so, _Black '47_ is proudly advertised as the \"_first film about the Great Famine_\". And were this true, it would undoubtedly occupy a canonical place in Irish artistic output in general, and Irish cinema in specific. However, there is one vital factor that everyone really needs to know before seeing it \u2013 it isn't the first film about the Famine. It's the first film set during the Famine, but it isn't about the Famine. This is a genre film, a pseudo-western revenge thriller set against the backdrop of the Famine. The Famine is not the film's central theme, nor does it attempt to engage with it on a national scale. If you accept that, and don't go in expecting to see Cecil Woodham-Smith's _The Great Hunger_ (1991) transposed to the screen, there's actually quite a lot here to admire.\r\n\r\nAs with many genre films, the plot is simplicity itself. It is winter 1847 in Connemara, two years since _Phytophthora infestans_ caused the failure of the potato crop on which large portions of the country's poor depend. Having deserted from the British Army's 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) after a difficult tour in Afghanistan, Martin Feeney (James Frecheville) returns home, unaware of the state of the country; everywhere, there is eviction, homelessness, starvation, and death. As people literally lie dying on the sides of the road, hundreds of thousands have already left Ireland for the United States. With Protestant clerics exploiting the crisis to compel Catholics peasants to convert in return for soup (\"_taking the soup_\"), grain is stockpiled for export to England. Travelling to his home, Feeney learns his immediate family is dead; his brother sentenced to hanging for resisting eviction, and his mother driven off the land after refusing to take the soup, subsequently dying of starvation and exposure. The only remaining family he has are his sister-in-law Ellie (the always excellent Sarah Greene), and her three children. Holding up in an abandoned cottage, Feeney persuades Ellie to join him in emigrating. However, the following day, an eviction party, led by the unscrupulous bailiff Cronin (Aidan McArdle) and the sadistic Sgt. Fitzgibbon of the Irish Constabulary (yet another strong performance from Moe Dunford), arrives with orders to eject the family and burn the property. Things soon turn violent, and Feeney is arrested. Held in a nearby garrison, he escapes, and sets about exacting revenge on the judge who hanged his brother, the people in the eviction party, the landlord who ordered the eviction, and anyone else who gets in his way. Meanwhile, learning of Feeney's escape, the British Army send a three-man team after him; the idealistic and pompous Sgt. Pope (Freddie Fox), the na\u00efve Pvt. Hobson (Barry Keoghan), and Feeney's former commander in the Rangers, the disillusioned and world-weary Hannah (Hugo Weaving). Considering Feeney a friend, Hannah is unenthusiastic about the mission, but has little choice, as he himself is awaiting execution, having killed a suspect he was supposed to be interrogating, and is told unless he brings Feeney back, his execution will go ahead. Soon joined by Conneely (Stephen Rea) as interpreter, bard, and geographical guide, the group set off after Feeney as he cuts an increasingly bloody path across the county towards the man his sees as the architect of the area's miseries; Lord Kilmichael (Jim Broadbent).\r\n\r\nBefore looking at why I enjoyed the film so much, a (very) small bit of background. The Famine is the single most significant event in Irish history; a cataclysmic tragedy on a biblical scale. Whilst you'll often hear it said that it was caused by either blight, an over-reliance on the potato crop, or colonial mismanagement (or organised genocide, if you believe Tim Pat Coogan), the fact is that it was the result of a myriad of factors, which, in 1845, combined to form a deadly perfect storm; bad luck, a natural occurrence, political ineptitude, pronounced socio-economic disparity, racism, massive poverty, national arrogance, etc. What is certain, however, is that it was a _completely_ preventable tragedy; even after the blight was initially recognised in 1844 (one year _prior_ to the crop failure), landowners continued to export grain. By the time 1847 had come around, the Irish Poor Law Extension Act had made Irish property owners fully responsible for public relief, and the \"Gregory Clause\" stated that any famer with at least a quarter of an acre was not eligible for such relief. The Amendment and the Clause, both ostensibly intended to ease the poor's suffering, had a catastrophic effect on the country, leading to an unprecedented rise in evictions. This was because the property tax assigned to pay for the Poor Law was levied on each rented holding, meaning it fell on landlords. Facing the possibility of this drastically increased taxation, many simply sidestepped the problem by evicting their tenants and destroying the dwellings. Simultaneously, due to the Gregory Clause, tens of thousands of tenants were trying to sell most of their land to the landlords so they could qualify for relief. However, because of the Amendment, many landlords refused to accept partial land surrenders, demanding instead the entire holding, plus the dwelling, which they could then burn, leading to a vicious cycle of homelessness, poverty, and destitution.\r\n\r\nBetween 1845 and 1852, around one-and-a-half million people died and nearly two million emigrated, reducing the populace by roughly 25% (1847 is known as \"Black '47\" because both the death and emigration rates were at their highest). In a lot of ways, the country still hasn't recovered; the Irish language was laid to waste; the myths and sagas of Irish folklore were forgotten for decades, until the advent of the Celtic Twilight and the _Athbheochan na Gaeilge_, and even with these movements, large portions of the folklore have never been reintegrated into the zeitgeist; the proud tradition of Irish bards changed forever, with thousands of songs lost; Irish literature slowed down to a trickle, taking over a hundred years before returning to its pre-Famine affluence; and hatred of the English occupiers became more galvanised than at any point in the previous 700 years of their presence \u2013 the common man blamed the Famine on the English, and for the first time, the poor and uneducated began to think along the lines of political insurgency.\r\n\r\nThe Famine was so devastating that even Irish literature, one of the finest literary traditions in the world, was reluctant to engage with it, both at the time, and ever since. Beyond a few poems by the likes of James Clarence Mangan, Aubrey De Vere, and Thomas D'Arcy McGee, isolated poetry like \"Thanatos, 1849\", and a few novels such as William Carleton's _The Black Prophet: A Tale of Irish Famine_ (1847), there really is no such thing as \"Famine literature\", certainly no Famine literary tradition. And even since then, the national literature has proved reluctant to engage, with only a few texts such as Patrick Kavanagh's _The Great Hunger_ (1942) and Seamus Heaney's \"At a Potato Digging\" (1966) willing to address it (even the masters, W.B. Yeats and James Joyce themselves, never explicitly dealt with the Famine head-on).\r\n\r\nAll of which brings us to _Black '47_. Considering how important an event this is in Irish history, it is as conspicuous by its absence from the national cinema as it is from the national literature. Here, however, there are practical considerations beyond the thematic enormity of the task; representing something of this scale and with this level of suffering is massively difficult on film, especially with a limited budget. And in any case, how does one fashion a narrative which could possibly convey the bleakness of the Famine. Maybe in this era of long-form narrative on TV, there's a possibility of doing something Famine-related, but condensing the most significant seven years in Irish history into a two (or three, or four) hour film is nigh-on impossible, not to mention the sheer unrelenting misery one would need to put on screen. It wouldn't exactly be a crowd-pleaser \u2013 watching an entire country slowly starve to death probably isn't going to pack Marvel fanboys into the local multiplex. And so, with that in mind, Black '47 has no intentions of dealing with the Famine on that kind of scale. This is a genre piece, it's a western, a revenge thriller. It's basically Clint Eastwood's _The Outlaw Josey Wales_ (1976), with Feeney having more than a hint of the Man with No Name.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, using the Famine as a backdrop for a genre exercise is probably a wise choice \u2013 it allows limited engagement by way of a plot-driven story, without setting up massive expectations (advertising hyperbole aside) and unconquerable thematic hurdles. Speaking to the _Irish Independent_, co-screenwriter/director Lance Daly explains,\r\n\r\n> _the genre route was the only way to go. I mean, do you want to make a film that's just about suffering, about people watching their children starve and families lying dead in their homes? Do you want to watch it, do you want to make it, do you want to be someone who tries to dramatise that? You had to tackle it in a less direct way._\r\n\r\nAnd whilst grafting an historical tragedy onto a generic template runs the risk of the tragedy muting the genre elements, and the genre distracting from the tragedy, Daly and his fellow screenwriters, Pierce Ryan, P.J. Dillon, and Eugene O'Brien, make a fine stab at it.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way also makes a great deal of sense for a number of additional reasons. For example, no Famine narrative could ever depict a story in which a protagonist rights all the wrongs of Ireland, because no such person existed. However, the relatively contained story of Feeney's revenge is more than aware of that. He is never painted as someone out to liberate the country, spurred on by the wrongs done to him personally \u2013 he's no Mel Gib\u2026sorry, William Wallace. He wants revenge on the people who wronged him; he has no aspirations of saving Ireland, and is powerless to do anything on a larger socio-economic canvas. The film never lets the audience forget this, whether it be shots of Feeney emotionlessly riding past starving peasants on the roadside, or his invasion of a Protestant soup tent, where he eats his own fill and then leaves. He's not the avenging spirit of Ireland made flesh, he's not C\u00fa Chulainn, Fionn mac Cumhaill, or one of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. This is not a piece of nationalist wish fulfilment, and it makes no claim to be.\r\n\r\nIn terms of how the film represents the Famine, apart from its importance to the plot, Daly employs a number of what could be called \"quintessential Famine images\". These include one of the first shots in the film, which shows a skull sinking into the wet mud, representing the dead and their connection to the land (a little on the nose, but it does the job); when Ellie first appears, she looks like Caitl\u00edn N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in, the implication being that Ireland itself is literally dying; when Ellie and her children are evicted, the scene is very much an archetype of such evictions \u2013 women and children crying, men being restrained, the thatched roof of a cottage burning, callous bailiffs, brutalising police; a Catholic priest warning the starving peasants not to take the soup (Feeney's disdain for this priest recalls the scene in Jim Sheridan's _The Field_ (1990) when the Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) reminds Fr. Doran (Sean McGinley) \"_no priests died in the time of the Famine, only poor people_\"); peasants taking the soup, a scene which throws up one of the most controversial and long-lasting ramifications of the Famine (more on this in a moment); grain being stockpiled for export to England; bedraggled peasants huddled at the gates of an affluent estate, begging the rich occupants to give them food, in a scene visually reminiscent of Rowan Gillespie's _Famine_ memorial on Dublin's Custom House Quay); multiple references to emigration. In point of fact, although the Famine is essentially just background, Daly works hard to make sure the viewer never forgets what's happening beyond the edges of the frame, by occasionally allowing it within the frame.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I thought I was going to hate _Black '47_ was because I thought it was entirely in English, which would have been patently ridiculous. Perhaps the most long-lasting effect of the Famine is that it decimated _Gaeilge_, the Irish language. The Famine is why this review is in English, and why I can speak only a few sentences in my native tongue. In seven years, the Famine did what the English couldn't manage in 700 \u2013 it destroyed that which defined us as a people, our very national identity. However, not only are large sections of _Black '47_ in Irish, the film actually uses the Irish language and the attempts to suppress it as an important recurring motif. For example, Feeney speaks both English and Irish, but he makes a conscious decision to only speak Irish, even when talking to non-Irish speakers, several of whom demand he speak in English. The film also shows a judge (Dermot Crowley) erupting in anger as peasants in his courtroom, unable to speak English, begin to converse in Irish, whilst Kilmichael refers to Gaeilge as \"_that aboriginal gibberish_\". However, the most important scene concerning the Irish language is one which recalls the linguistic brilliance of Brian Friel's play, Translations (1980). In the Protestant soup kitchen, when the priest asks a peasant his name, the man replies \"_S\u00e9amus \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in_\". The priest turns around to a translator, who responds, \"_James Sullivan_\". This speaks to the Anglicisation of Irish place names by the British (B\u00e9al an \u00c1tha became Ballina, D\u00fan Dealgan became Dundalk, Tr\u00e1 L\u00ed became Tralee, etc), itself an attempt to destroy the language and undermine our sense of place. Daly never allows the devastating effect the Famine had on the language to fade too far into the background, and the narrative is all the better for it.\r\n\r\nThe film also seems to have one eye on the contemporary political climate. For example, the scenes of English gentry seizing land and demolishing homes perhaps alludes to the situation in Palestine, where Israeli forces can be seen doing essentially the same thing. Even more pertinent, and closer to home, the scenes of empty dwellings, as people try to survive in ditches, clearly alludes to the ludicrous phenomenon of empty, boarded-up houses found all over Dublin, which, for some reason best known to the council, can't be let out to the ever-increasing number of homeless families. Similarly, the scenes of people dying on the side of the road recalls the bitter 2018 winter, when four homeless people died on the streets of Dublin within a few weeks of one another. Even the eviction scene is comparable to contemporary events; just last week, at the behest of a landlord, balaclava wearing Garda\u00ed, flanked by private security personnel (also wearing balaclavas), violently evicted a peaceful Take Back the City protest which had occupied an empty house in Dublin so as to highlight the growing homeless crisis.\r\n\r\nLooking beyond the Famine, thematically, the film hits the ground running; the first scene is Hannah's murder of his prisoner, which is preceded by a short debate between the two on the issue of loyalty to one's nation vs duty to the Crown, a duality with which Hannah wrestles for the duration of the plot. Indeed, speaking of Hannah, he and Feeney are very much two sides of the same coin; they are, for all intents and purposes, Javert and Jean Valjean, locked into a pursuit by a system neither of them respect. In fact, in relation to this, whereas Hugo gradually fazes Javert out of the narrative, Daly goes in the opposite direction \u2013 as the film progresses, Hannah comes to the fore and Feeney drops into the background. This has the effect of making Feeney seem almost non-human, an elemental force who turns up now and again when things kick off, and it's a really well handled structural component.\r\n\r\nOf course, all of this is not to say the film is perfect. Composer Brian Byrne's score, which features a heavy usage of uilleann pipes, is decent, but overly didactic. Additionally, the character of Kilmichael is something of a clich\u00e9d, token villain, coming out with lines such as \"_this potato business has simplified things considerably_\". Daly also has a slight tendency to unsuccessfully mix naturalism with stylisation, perhaps most obvious in the use of intentionally artificial looking matte paintings as backgrounds in some of the panoramic scenes. Whilst the intention behind this was most likely to try to evoke the look of old sepia photographs, contemporary audiences used to photorealistic CGI in every shot will probably interpret it as cheap effects work, which is a shame, and does the film no favours. Finally, if there's one thing I was surprised that wasn't mentioned, especially given all the references to emigration, it would be the coffin ship, the image of which is a permanent component of the Famine's legacy in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHowever, all things considered, this is a strong and reasonably important piece of filmmaking. Yes, it's essentially just a revenge western, and yes, in that sense, it's nothing overly special; there are a hundred films along these lines, and several of them are better than _Black '47_. However, Daly allows the Famine background to come to the fore sufficiently so that we never forget when and where we are, and because of this, it's undoubtedly an important film. Mixing the historical with the generic just enough so that each informs the other without either becoming (too) diluted, it's not the first \"Famine film\", but it is a very decent, honest, and respectful attempt to put something (anything) of that great tragedy on screen. And that is something to be lauded.",

            "Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/Geuu7kVab2k\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows me will know that I'm fan of dark and dreary movies and the Netflix movie _Black 47_ certainly meets this description.\r\n\r\n_In 1847, when Ireland is in the grip of the Great Famine that has ravaged the country for two long years, Feeney, a hardened Irish Ranger who has been fighting for the British Army abroad, returns home to reunite with his estranged family, only to discover the cruelest reality, a black land where death reigns._\r\n\r\nI love a good revenge film and this delivers on its promise of a cold hard story. This is a real solid film that had me gripped right from the get-go. James Frecheville who plays Feeney is dead eyed and terrifying as he slowly tracks down those that have done wrong to his family, and you can't help but cheer him on as the a-hole English soldiers chase him. Hugo Weaving is great as Hannah, the former soldier tasked with helping the English chase Feeney, and the cat and mouse game that ensues really pulled me in. The conflict that Hannah has plays well into the story, and his \"in it for his own reasons\" angle adds a good \"will he or won't he\" aspect to the events of the film.\r\n\r\nThe film makers do an excellent job of showing just how hard and awful things were during the Irish famine, and how cheap life was. There is a courthouse scene where someone is sentenced to hard labour in Tasmania, half a world away for the crime of stealing a sheep to feed his family. In fact that mention of Tasmania, and the film as a whole reminded me a lot of the absolutely brilliant film _The Nightingale_, that we watched last year. If you enjoyed _The Nightingale_ then this too will be right up your alley.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for a bleak and hopeless film with a huge grey zone between good guys and bad guys, _Black 47_ will be a worthy addition to your watchlist."

            "First and foremost, this film feels like someone went to their local grocery store, grabbed a random three-dollar mystery novel off the checkout shelf, and decided to make it a movie with some extremely popular and attractive people. In other words, it's a silly mystery movie with crazy, zany twists and turns.\r\n\r\nSome of those twists and turns were easy enough to see coming, but some of them were straight out of left field. In addition to the entertaining twists, the film does a decent job of not taking itself seriously. The humor in the movie is peppered in during great moments. Some of it is cheesy, but if you're going to this film for a deep, thought-provoking film, don't.\r\n\r\nThe characters themselves are all extremely exaggerated. Lively's Emily is over-the-top sophisticated, crass, and private to the point where she won't allow pictures or even paintings of her face. Kendrick's Stephanie is bubbly, eager, awkward, and overly friendly. The rest of the cast fills in the needs around them, and while the cast is filled with one-note characters, they fulfill the needs well. Golding's Sean was my least favorite, but mainly because he doesn't have a defined archetype in a film filled with single-aspect characters.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the film is the plot itself. Emily contradicts herself with the motive for her faking her own death. She tells Sean that she did it for him and for Nicky. Then she says she did it for her. On top of it all, she doesn't appear to have a plan to get the insurance money after it comes through. The film could have easily alleviated all of these issues with a quick scene or a line about fake passports for Emily and Nicky.\r\n\r\nAll in all, A Simple Favor is a fun romp filled with crazy twists and turns, humor, and great acting. Don't think too much about the film itself, and just go have some fun. It's definitely worth a getaway matinee.",

More recently, novels such as Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel, _Gone Girl_ (and David Fincher's 2014 filmic adaptation), have expanded and popularised the suburban noir genre; the very genre that _A Simple Favour_'s satirical excesses primarily target. A comedic look at the lives of two young mothers in an affluent American suburb, coupled with a mystery plot, the film has an undeniable identity crisis due to its genre mash-up characteristics (it's a comic/satirical suburban noir murder mystery thriller). Although director Paul Feig proves adept at handling the parodic side of things, in the latter stages, he seems to be trying to ensure the film can exist (relatively) un-ironically within the very genre it's attempting to lampoon. And he doesn't particularly succeed. Despite this schizophrenic quality, however, the interplay between the two leads, the heavy stylisation, the playfully self-aware nature of the aesthetic, and the success of the burlesque elements all serve to make the film undeniably entertaining.\r\n\r\nAdapted by Jessica Sharzer from Darcey Bell's 2017 novel, _A Simple Favour_ tells the story of Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a widowed single-mum who runs a life hacks vlog with minimal viewership. Overzealous in her desire to be liked, to the point where she's deeply unlikable, Stephanie is the kind of person who signs up for every volunteer project at her son's school, and then feigns surprise when she's told she can only work on one at a time. Enter Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), a public relations executive for a major fashion label. When Miles (Joshua Satine) and Nicky (Ian Ho), Stephanie and Emily's sons, respectively, ask for a playdate, Emily is initially unenthusiastic. However, she acquiesces, and she and Stephanie are soon bonding over increasingly strong martinis and girl chats, with Stephanie in awe of Emily, who seems to have it all; a good-looking novelist/lecturer husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a gorgeous house, a successful career, a great kid, and an acerbic attitude that Stephanie would kill for. However, all is not as perfect as it first seems; there are not insignificant financial problems; when Stephanie takes a photograph of Emily, Emily reacts angrily, demanding Stephanie delete it; although she and Sean have a great physical relationship, there isn't much else there, with Emily frustrated that his only successful novel was published over ten years ago. Several weeks later, with Emily held up at work, she asks Stephanie to pick up Nicky, and she'll collect him later. Except she doesn't collect him. As a few days go by, and no one seems to know where Emily is, Stephanie and Sean report her missing. However, unsatisfied with the direction the investigation is taking, Stephanie is soon amateur sleuthing her way across the country in an effort to track down her friend.\r\n\r\nObviously taking inspiration from suburban-based \"mommy murder mysteries\" such as _Gone Girl_ and Paula Hawkins's 2012 _The Girl on the Train_, as well as films such as Stanley Donen's _Charade_ (1963), _A Simple Favour_ is at its best when working as a parody/satire of such narratives, its own source material included. From what little I know of the book, it seems as if everything is played straight, with little discernible sense of sarcasm, even as the plot twists become ever more ludicrous. With this in mind, it makes sense that the filmmakers have elected to adapt such un-ironically thrashy material in a more self-reflexive manner, as this facilitates the gentle (and often not so gentle) ribbing of the genre, exposing some of its more ill-conceived and unrealistic tropes to ridicule. For example, the three main characters are all standard generic templates to the point of clich\u00e9; the _ing\u00e9nue_ who feels honour-bound to do everything she can to find the truth, no matter the cost, ultimately learning as much about herself as anything else; the sardonic, caustic, and utterly shady plot catalyst, who always seems to have an ace up her sleeve and always seems to know more than anyone else; and, the brilliant but frustrated spouse who may, or may not, be in on the crime at the narrative's centre. However, their archetypal characteristics are dialled up to such a degree (Stephanie is the definition of innocence, Emily is the type of person that simply doesn't exist in the real world, Sean is impossibly attractive, funny, intelligent, and kind), that they can't help but seem caricatures. Similarly, everything is presented in such a nonchalant and laid back manner that the twists, which in a more self-serious film would occupy centre stage, are often rendered absurd. However, and this is the key point, _A Simple Favour_ is very much in on the joke. Most of the time.\r\n\r\nOpening with a late 1960s Europop-influenced Saul Bass-esque title sequence complete with sliding split-screens and pastel colours, scored to Jean Paul Keller's 1967 \"Ca s'est arrange\", the film signals its playful tone right from the off. This emphasis on stylisation is perhaps seen most clearly upon Emily's introduction. As Stephanie, Miles, and Nicky shelter from the rain, Emily emerges from a car in slow motion, with the camera starting on her feet before slowly moving up to her head as she raises an umbrella. Cutting to a mid-shot, she then begins to walk across the carpark (still in slow motion), as a broken umbrella blows past her, replacing the tumbleweed of a classic western shootout. Apart from being a memorable introduction to the character, the visual design of the scene is predicated on cine-literacy, showing that the filmmakers are more than aware of standard genre tropes, and, more importantly, how to employ them for comedic effect.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the entire film revels in its own intertextual awareness, with later references to such defining noir texts as George Cukor's _Gaslight_ (1944), Alfred Hitchcock's _Spellbound_ (1945), and Henri-Georges Clouzet's _Les diaboliques_ (1955). Another element of this awareness is the use of a fractured narrative structure, so beloved of classic noir mysteries. Large portions of the film feature narration within narration (and oftentimes narration within narration within narration), as well as making use of another classic noir staple; the unreliable narrator. The film gets significant mileage out of scenes where the aural narration doesn't even come close to matching the visuals; i.e., the narrator is lying, and both the narratee and the audience are aware of such. An especially funny example of this is when Stephanie tells Emily about kissing her step-brother after their father's funeral, and Emily immediately knows she is lying that she only kissed him (leading to her new nickname for Stephanie, \"_brotherfucker_\"). Whilst the narrator (Stephanie) flat-out denies she slept with him, the audience sees them having sex, confirming the narratee's (Emily) suspicions. This technique is used several times in the film, and it's an extremely well-handled narrative device.\r\n\r\nThe film's main target for satire, however, is not really a specific genre (suburban noir) or even the tropes that define that genre \u2013 it's the _milieu_ that enables the existence of that genre in the first place. Together, Stephanie, Emily, and Sean represent everything that's rotten with the sterilised, emotionally deadening middle-class suburban sphere in which they're (seemingly) trapped. However, the film doesn't condemn them for being horrible people, rather it exults in their awfulness, deftly directing, redirecting, and misdirecting the audience's sympathies, to the point where it becomes difficult to say who is screwing over whom. Every time the film seems to settle on who the villains are, it does something to disrupt the audience's perceptions, and oftentimes, so as to achieve maximum satirical impact, precisely when the character we are now being asked to empathise with is up to something somewhat less than moral. This is the very essence of black comedy \u2013 the film presents a hideous world populated by hideous people who do hideous things to one another, but it does so in such a cheerful and uplifting manner that you simply can't help but laugh at the shenanigans.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this, the film works especially well when jauntily charting the friendship between Stephanie and Emily, two women who have no businesses co-existing. I don't particularly understand Anna Kendrick's popularity. Although she seems perfectly amiable in real-life, she plays the exact same character in every film, and that character is Anna Kendrick. However, it works here because, a) it's the perfect foil to the \"screw-you\" persona of Emily, and b) Kendrick and Lively have such effortless chemistry (it's one of those films that, as you watch, you know they had a blast making). The two women are just so fundamentally different that it wouldn't take much to make their early scenes together work, but everything is in place to amplify the comedy \u2013 the lively script, the great acting, the unintrusive direction, the brightly-lit and garish interiors, the clashing wardrobes. Lively plays Emily as a mischievous, experienced charmer, the kind of person who acts like they know your secrets ten seconds after meeting you, whilst Kendrick's Stephanie is all self-deprecating intellectualism, trailed-off sentences, and statements phrased like questions. Frankly, I could have watched two hours of just the two of them trading good-natured barbs, pushing each other's buttons, and swapping sex stories.\r\n\r\nIf there was one element of the film that didn't work, however, it was the mystery plot. Yes, I get that it's all a satire of the multi-twist-for-twist's-sake suburban murder mystery, with the preposterousness of such plots played for maximum farcicality. However, the satirical underpinning doesn't change the fact that the entire mystery at the film's centre is insipid, uninteresting, and predictable, whilst Feig seems patently unable to bridge the tone of the frothier comic moments and the darker ones which become increasingly prevalent towards the end. Granted, the film is not a spoof, \u00e0 la something like Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker's _Airplane!_ (1980), so we can't expect absurdist humour throughout, but nevertheless, rather than choosing to employ a relatively even tone, Feig seems to have made the decision to mix scenes of outright comedy with predominantly serious scenes devoid of laughter. And it doesn't work. For example, the film features a scene in which someone who has just been ploughed by a car and is trying to crawl away is nonchalantly told if they don't stop, they're going to hurt their knees. That's pretty dark, but it's also pretty funny. However, it comes only a short while after a scene in which a drug-addict is held under the water and drowned. Not a huge amount to laugh at there. If scenes of this nature are supposed to be satiric, and hence feed into the film's engagement with the suburban noir, I couldn't see any evidence of it, and as a result, the tonal disparity becomes very jarring towards the end.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, I found _A Simple Favour_ enjoyable. The purely-satirical early scenes earn enough goodwill so that the less successful more plot-heavy later scenes don't completely tear the whole thing down. The film as a whole shines a not unwelcome light on the increasingly self-important suburban noir, and for the most part, the parody is very well-judged. When the comedy is forced to retreat in the service of more serious material, the tonal balance is definitely knocked off, as the film comes dangerously close to valorising that which it has set out to mock. Despite this, however, _A Simple Favour_ remains entertaining. Distractingly attractive people wear ridiculously stylish clothes in a stylised cine-literate parody \u2013 it won't change your life, but it's a very rewarding couple of hours.",

            "I like this movie more than the one with Silvester Stallone. Nice slowmotion shots and a good story for an action movie.",
            "This film blow me away! I was not expecting this, a cop (a judge) based in the future with high violent's and great characters. You will think you will hate Dredd but you wont.",
            "I think this adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics books are a much more how most people probably would expect that a Judge Dredd movie should be, especially compared to the rather disappointing 1995 version. That of course means that the movie is quite violent. Anyone who has ever read the comics should not be surprised about the fact that this movie is mostly about taking out the bad guys, and if you cannot take out the bad guys using violence then just use more violence.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few gripes that I will come to I quite liked this movie. The plot is a fairly simple one but it is also a plot that I would not have been surprised to find in one of the 2000 AD comics. It is a quite suitable plot for a Judge Dredd movie. The plot centres around the drug \u201cSlo-Mo\u201d which slows down your perception of time. This of course gave the director carte blanche to use extreme slow motion effects which could have been quite annoying if overdone. I think it is used quite well in this movie though. I especially liked the effects on the people standing behind the door that Dredd blew in at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nJudge Dredd himself is well played by Karl Urban and, thankfully, he does not remove the helmet in this movie. I\u2019m sure it was done to satisfy Stallone\u2019s ego in the 1995 movie and it was one of the things that ruined it. Judge Dredd is not supposed to remove his helmet, period. \u201cMa-Ma\u201d is also a quite okay bad guy for this movie. Sufficiently psychopathic yet intelligent and rational enough to make a believable, at least as believable as a Judge Dredd villain can be, adversary to Dredd.\r\n\r\nI have a few gripes about the movie though. My main gripe is that it is not the ultra-modern city from the comics, at least from the comics that I have read since I have not read them all. It is more of a bunch of mega-scrapers spread out among the city slum that is left from today and still looks very non-futuristic. The initial chase scene is done using an old Volkswagen van for Christ sake. I really did not like that and, as far as I am concerned, it lost a star for that. If I remember the comics correctly MegaCity One was built more or less on top of the old ruins.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I did not like was the crooked judges. Ii is possible that they used the concept of a bad judge in some of the comics, I do not remember, but I still did not like it. The judges are supposed to be above \u201cordinary people\u201d. I am sure that they could have come up with some other plot element than that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the bottom line is that I quite enjoyed the movie. The fact that the DTS-HD Master Audio sound on my Blu-ray copy was excellent did add to the enjoyment of course. The surround and LFE effects was quite powerful yet balanced so they did not cause my somewhat weak subwoofer to go into resonance. Very enjoyable movie evening indeed.",
            "About a million years ago (1980-85ish), when I was a boy, I bought a comic each and every week called 2000AD. And I loved it. I mean, properly LOVED it. The flagship strip in this publication was (and all these years later, remains) Judge Dredd. The titular lead character (his name, a play on that of novelty UK ska/reggae artist Judge Dread - who himself lifted the moniker from a Prince Buster tune - although there any similarity ends, absolutely) was a \"Judge\", a one-tier law enforcement agent with the authority to arrest, charge, try and sentence perpetrators of crime on the spot (including issuing the death sentence, a sentence dealt out frequently), operating in the early 22nd century in Mega City One, a post-apocalyptic overpopulated dystopian conurbation stretching from Boston to Washington DC. A grim, violent piece, it nevertheless managed to mine some gallows humour from the ultra-right wing dispensing of justice, especially as doled out by our perpetually helmeted Dirty Harry-style anti-hero (of course, Harry Callaghan was constantly railing against the system. Not so Joe Dredd; he WAS the f*cking system).\r\n\r\nThere were many different colourful characters within the pages of 2000AD but Dredd was by far the favourite (generally speaking; My personal favourite was Strontium Dog, followed closely by Nemesis the Warlock and The A.B.C. Warriors) and was always the one most ripe for a possible movie adaptation somewhere down the line. And so it was that in 1994 promising British director Danny Cannon was attached to direct Judge Dredd - the next Sylvester Stallone movie. D'Oh! Anyway, the movie was released in 1995 and it was pretty-much a travesty, top-to-bottom. Cannon, it appeared, was simply hired to be Stallone's bitch, and despite the thing looking the part (the art department deserve some props for that film, you know) Stallone seemed determined to kick any in-place mythology straight in the bin if he didn't fancy it (Dredd never takes his helmet off, because the law is faceless, or something; Stallone takes his helmet off. Judges don't have relations with one another; Dredd develops a love interest with comic strip regular Judge Hershey. Thuggish recurring anti-hero Fergee is reduced to comic relief, major MAJOR Dredd arch-enemies The Angel Gang are reduced to one-scene throwaways and a robot looking A LOT like Hammerstein from The A.B.C. Warriors is introduced for no good reason whatsoever).\r\n\r\nAnd that, it seemed, was that. Nice one, Sly.\r\n\r\nUntil now. Finally, almost two decades of time and blockbuster, money-spinning superhero comic adaptations at the cinemas seems to have washed much of the foul stench of Sylvesters \"oeuf de poo-poo\" away, and for the final flush, here at last is the reboot: Dredd, starring Karl Urban (The Bourne Supremacy, Doom) and directed by Pete Travis (Vantage Point, Endgame) with a budget half that of its turkey-basted predecessor (more like a quarter when adjusting for inflation). So, what's it like? Well, if you're a fan of the source material you're going to have to throw out all of your notions of what Dredd and his Mega City environment should look like. Although neither nailed it aesthetically, the Cannon/Stallone movie looks the part more than this one. Until someone wants to commit Avatar-sized monies to the project, I don't know if anyone will ever truly nail it. No, this one is a rough and dirty thing, reminiscent of the sort of nasty, faceless sh*tholes you'll find in the Death Wish franchise of movies. Still, beauty's only skin-deep, they say, and what's important is that this movie captures the eighties vision of dystopian future in exactly the manner that Judge Dredd the comic strip did all those years ago. It \"feels\" like Judge Dredd, in a way that the Stallone movie never did, despite oh-so-many more bells and whistles.\r\n\r\nThe plot? The plot is simplicity itself. Dredd is assigned to accompany and evaluate new recruit Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a mutant who failed the Judge's aptitude test by a hair's breadth but who possesses a remarkable psychic ability to read peoples' minds, which the Justice Department obviously would want to exploit, IF Dredd decides that she can cut it as a Judge. Out they go to investigate a triple gangland-style execution in the Peach Trees city block, one of the thousands of futuristic high-rises that can hold 70,000 inhabitants, many of whom never have to leave the block in their entire lives. This particular block is ruled over by drug boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, 300), who ordered the executions. In an early exchange, Dredd & Anderson capture one of Ma-Ma's goons, and Anderson ascertains via her psychic skills that this particular goon was among those directly responsible for the executions. They decide to take him back to the Hall of Justice for questioning so's they can get the goods on head honcho Ma-Ma and her drug-traffiking industry but before they can do so, Ma-Ma seizes control of the security department of the block, locks the entire place down trapping the judges inside, and tells everybody inside to either help her kill the judges or get the f*ck out of her way; anyone helping the judges can expect to be killed too. So, Dredd and Anderson can either hide out until backup arrives, try to break out of the block somehow, or go up the building and after Ma-Ma, to kill her before she kills them. Which of those options do you suppose our man is going to go for?\r\n\r\nIn many ways, this film could've been called \"Anderson\" rather than \"Dredd\" (though obviously that wouldn't have been as marketable) since it's Anderson - played to just the right tone by Olivia Thirlby - who grows throughout this movie. And that's as it should be with Dredd: he DOESN'T change, he DOESN'T grow. He is a rock, a constant. Karl Urban - a childhood fan of Dredd himself - understands this and plays him to perfection (WITHOUT removing his helmet once; again, as it should be. Poxy Stallone). He's Robocop, without the warmth. For me though, the standout is Lena Headey. I wasn't enamoured at all with the idea of a \"new\" character as the main antagonist, and some whore-turned-druglord just smelled like that first \"market\" scene in Hannibal to me. But she's brilliant, really vicious. And the drug that Ma-Ma is pushing - Slo-Mo, which causes users to experience time at a tiny fraction of its real speed - allows us to view things through the eyes of the users, which in turn allows for some excellent slow-motion ballets of gruesome violence. And whilst the gore stays just-about on the cartoonish edge of things, this IS a very, VERY gruesome movie. About as gory as I've ever seen outside of the horror genre. But it moves at a real lick, it never lets up and it's all done and dusted inside the 90-minute mark. Lovely.\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, Dredd hasn't made its money back at the cinemas; a shame for a film that has had largely positive reviews and word-of-mouth. Still, it'll definitely go into the black when the DVD/blu-rays are released in the next couple of weeks, and that'll hopefully trigger a sequel or even the trilogy that writer Alex Garland wants to make. According to him, Dredd III - if it gets that far - will feature the Dark Judges. And that thought makes me quiver with excitement, like a boy reading his first copy of 2000AD, a million years ago.",
            "So, nothing new under the sun. The same boring story and characters mixed in another movie. The only thing remarkable in this movie is the slow motion used during the drug usage, which is not much to say.",
            "I really was quite a fan of Dredd, I thought the actors, post-staff, director, writers and cinematographer all did an outstanding job. However, there is one man in the crew who makes the rest look bad.\r\nBy comparison.\r\nBecause Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack is by leaps and bounds the standout piece of what was already a decent film by its own right. His work on Dredd is praise enough (he also did spectacular thing's for Limitless in 2011).\r\nI never got into the deeper Judge Dredd universe (ie. 2000 AD comics) and almost all of my knowledge comes from cursory internet searches, and that \"Dredd VS Death\" video game. But from what I can gather, Dredd is a more honest depiction of the source material than the Stallone-led Judge Dredd of '95.\r\nSo the music is outstanding, the Slow-Mo scenes are innovative and spectacularly produced and the specialised ammunition are astounding to watch. These are the three best parts of the film, in descending order, which to be fair, means that the gimmicks of Dredd are its most impressive feature. It's story is not broad (More of a \"day in the life\" than \"save the human race\" deal) and its characters are not greatly explored (though certainly not shallow), and it's mostly held together by these aforementioned \"gimmicks\", but more power to them! Better to have a solid baseline interconnected with deeply original fascination, than to have a boring rehashed piece of crap baseline, loosely stapled together with some poor excuse for dumping the same cliche $100,000 CGI explosions we've already seen four hundred times this quarter.\r\nSurprisingly, New Zealender Karl Urban (Star Trek, Star Trek: Into Darkness, LotR trilogy) makes for a better Dredd than I'd anticipated. Having a psychic was something I was initially sceptical of, too, however Olivia Thrilby (Juno, The Darkest Hour) put my concerns to rest after a long enough period to buy her role (about 25 minutes). And Lena Headey (Sarah Connor Chronicles, The Purge, Game of Thrones) I've liked since she played Queen Gorgo from 300 nearly a decade ago, so she\"s always a safe bet in my books, particularly in the role of relentless druglord Ma-Ma, she really is at home playing ruthless women of power, isn't she?\r\nThat all said, Dredd is not the best film I've ever seen. It's not even the best action-focused science-fiction film released in 2012 I've ever seen. But it takes risks, and that's nothing to be scoffed at. We need more Dredd's in our film industries, something to break up the monotony of most of Hollywood. Something that doesn't need to go big, or tick x amount of acceptability boxes, it's satisfied just being good.\r\n 77%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",
            "Incendiary!\r\n\r\nDredd is directed by Pete Travis and written by Alex Garland. It stars Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, Lena Headey and Wood Harris. Music is by Paul Leonard-Morgan and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.\r\n\r\nReview for 2D Version Only.\r\n\r\nSylvester Stallone' 1995 attempt at bringing Judge Dredd to the big screen was met with a critical mauling, both professionally and by serious fans of the 2000AD comic books from whence the character came. On its own terms it's a fun popcorn piece, but one that totally missed the fascist grime of the source. Here however, under the guidance of Travis and Garland, Dredd gets the picture the fans and the character deserves.\r\n\r\nPlot is simple, we are in a dystopian future in a place known as Mega-City One. The only law and order are the Judges who are able to act as judge, jury and executioner. One such feared judge is Judge Dredd (Urban) and when he and his partner in training, Anderson (Thirlby), answer a call to a triple homicide at the multi storey slum tenement known as Peach Trees, they are locked in by crime boss Ma-Ma (Headey) and forced to defend themselves against practically everyone who resides there.\r\n\r\nThis is stripped down to the essence of what makes Judge Dredd such a beloved character in comic book lore. There's no need for backstories, love interests or comedy side-kicks, this is bad ass characters from either side of the law going at it full throttle. The action is unrelenting and explosive in its construction, bloody and brutal into the bargain as well.\r\n\r\nDredd the character is rightly kept to a basic level, he's a hard dude in a suit and helmet, with an arsenal of weapons upon his person and he delivers short sharp shock pieces of dialogue with gruff assertiveness. Anderson is a mutant of sorts, she can read minds, which superbly adds spice to this fight for survival narrative. Ma-Ma is a damaged villain, disgustingly menacing without histrionics, it's her calmness that's so terrifying.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the criminal activities fronted by Ma-Ma is a new drug called Slo-Mo, a drug that reduces the brain's perception to 1% of speed. This allows the makers to bring some dazzling effects into play whilst setting up some blood letting scenarios. The production design is top draw, where Mega-City One has a perfect totalitarianism sheen to it, which in turn is boosted by Dod Mantle's excellent colour lenses.\r\n\r\nWith Urban perfectly cast and his two lady co-stars also firing, Dredd is a thrilling action sci-fi movie. It doesn't push new boundaries and raise the bar per se, but it keeps the fires well and truly burning in the genre whilst appeasing the fans wholesale. 8/10",
            "I used to read the comics when I was young, and they were simple, straightforward shoot 'em ups with \"Dredd\" the epitome of tough, no-nonsense law enforcement in a futuristic environment where crime, violence, poverty and unemployment were pretty normal for many people. This time, Karl Urban takes the title role as the policeman/judge/jury type, and he and his rookie \"Anderson\" (Olivia Thirlby) investigate a few dead bodies in the lobby of an hundred-odd storey building controlled by the drug dealing matriarch \"Ma-Ma\" (Lena Headey) and her menacing henchmen. To begin with, they must find the killer and get out alive - but when some of his own kind arrive and turn against him - and his partner is captured - he sets out to settle this once and for all. Yep, the dialogue is shocking; the acting only little better (Headey is about as menacing as yesterday's creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e) but that's not the point. It's meant to be a brutal action adventure - loads of pyrotechnics, attitude, gun-battles (with some great weapons, btw) that is just aimless fun. That's what is says on the tin, and that's what is does. Never any doubt about the ending, but the route is what it's all about - and for me, anyway, it's just 90 minutes of mindless escapism with a bit of mind-reading thrown in for good measure. Not everything can be Jane Austen - aim low and you ought not to be too disappointed."

But even the top-ranking Judge, Dredd, discovers that taking down Ma-Ma isn\u2019t as easy as it seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series."

            "\"Director Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur\u2019s vast, encompassing vision thematically broaches the existential drive that consumes extreme climbers, questioning both the brusque heroism and innate fatalism of those that attempt to conquer such harsh climes...\"\r\n\r\nFull review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2015/9/10/everest.html",
            "1996, and Mother Nature's big mama is playing her hand again.\r\n\r\nBased on a true story, Everest tells about a climbing expedition on the world's highest mountain that would become devastated by a severe snow storm.\r\n\r\nShe stands and watches over us all, she is Mount Everest, and climbing her is seen as one of the pinnacles of mountaineering. No matter how many lives are lost over the years, there will always be another group of adventurers ready to take on the mountain and the elements that come with her.\r\n\r\nThe ill fated 1996 trek up Everest gets a worthy cinematic treatment here. Sure it suffers from some of the pitfalls of the disaster movie genre, such as weak characterisations and fake sequences, but emotional investment is high and ready to be grasped by those so inclined. The drama on the mountain is gripping, and thankfully this is matched by the frantic concurrent story strands involving the family and friends waiting at base camp and the family homes. Cinematography is often breathtaking, the acting performances as solid as one of Everest' rock faces, but it's the story that sells itself. A tale well worth reading about, and the cynical among us should do well to remember this fact. 8/10",
            "> One of the most realistically approached adventure movie based on the real.\r\n\r\nI was completely surprised with the movie. Because I was expecting 'Vertical Limit' kind of movie. Like, you know, there's no heroic adventure with the incredible stunt sequences in it. But it was very real and more real. Usually while adapting the true events for the screen, unnecessary overdose stunts created to commercialise the product. But in this it was too much closer to the real world adventure, like a documentary film.\r\n\r\nIt was a man versus the mother nature and nothing else. The human villains were not included or the romance and other subplots. It was a multi starrer movie. Lots of big names played only a small role and magnified the expectation for the movie. But like I said expecting awesomeness will lead you to a great disappointment. One must approach this movie with a clear mind for a good result, because I felt the film very honest, and being honest is always a bit boring.\r\n\r\nThe film was emotionally very strong. No character developments, not individually, but the entire film was focused on one particular expedition taken by a couple of trekking teams that goes wrong after they got hit by a storm. This is Jason Clarke's one of the best films in a lead role, as well as for the director of 'Contraband'. I definitely regret missing it out in digital 3D. It is a good watch, absolutely refreshing from the mainstream commercial films.\r\n\r\n7/10",
            "I have read dozens of books about mountaineering expeditions, and several about this particular disastrous climbing season, including Jon Krakuer\u2019s bestseller. Overall I think they did a good job depicting the events in this movie, which makes sense, as they used the expertise of Guy Cotter, a climbing and business partner of Rob Hall, one of the expedition leaders in the forefront of this tragedy.\r\n\r\nThey do an adequate job of putting the grandeur of the mountain on display, while still focusing on the human interactions and personal physical challenges of the characters. The plot runs fairly true to events and the dialogue is well-written. They made changes, of course, such as details of the helicopter rescue scene, but stayed true to the important stuff.\r\n\r\nI think I agree with the above-mentioned Guy Cotter, who stated in an interview that he only wished they had depicted in more depth the motivations of climbers to risk their lives climbing up in the \u201cDeath Zone.\u201d For some climbers of Everest, their reasons are mundane: to be able to gain respect by saying they did it, or to \u201cinspire\u201d others to be all they can be, or even to make money and win some measure of fame. \r\n\r\nBut the true mountaineers are driven by  something deeper, close to what they see as their self identity.  They can\u2019t not climb. There is exhilaration in challenging their physical limits and in appreciation of the rare beauty found at high altitudes. If it was easy they might not do so much of it, being in an odd way addicted to the pain, cold and danger. WHen they are on the mountains they dream of home; when they are home they dream of the mountains. It\u2019s reminds me of aging boxing champions who keep on fighting when they should retire. Oh, they want the money, obviously, but even well-off champions may fight on and endure pain and suffering inside the ring for the cheers of the crowd and the additional acclaim it may bring them.",
            "Based on true events, this rather beautifully shot film tells the story of Kiwi Rob Hall (an adequate Jason Clarke) who ran an exclusive adventure agency that took well-heeled climbers up Mount Everest. In 1996 he decided to team up with accomplished but rather enigmatic mountaineer Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal). What now ensues are a rather join-the-dot series of predicable escapades as the mountain decides that it's had enough of these messy and polluting human gadflies on it's slopes, and so it fights back - impressively and decisively. That leads us to the problem with this - the characterisations are seriously undercooked. I didn't really feel that I knew any of them, nor did I actually find - especially with Gyllenhaal - that I cared whether they survived or not. That might be a testament to their acting skills - some creating an aura of complacency and arrogance that well deserved their just desserts, but for the most part the script and the story were just all a bit flat. The cinematography is astonishing though, with actuality of the Nepalese base camps and of the rather benign looking mountain itself. It features quite a notable supporting cast, but again they offer little to beef up the sense of personality here or give us any real sense of the danger, teamwork and camaraderie that must have prevailed in real life. It is watchable for the imagery, and it also serves to remind up that mankind is pretty insignificant when the planet decides to stir itself against us, but as a piece of drama it's all just too lacklustre."

        "overview": "Inspired by the incredible events surrounding a treacherous attempt to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain, \"Everest\" documents the awe-inspiring journey of two different expeditions challenged beyond their limits by one of the fiercest snowstorms ever encountered by mankind.

            "I'm looking for the owner of that horse. He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!\r\n\r\nIt's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!\r\n\r\nHere for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into \"The Battle of Branston Bridge\", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffr\u00e8 as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.\r\n\r\nThe Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.\r\n\r\nThere's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!\r\n\r\nFrom the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10",
            "Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> is a classic Western film. Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film's comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.\r\n\r\nThe film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a \"two buddies on the road\" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a \"spaghetti Western\", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.",
            "I am not a fan of Sergio Leone. In fact, this movie and Once Upon a Time in the West are the only movies of his that I have seen. But I think they are both classic westerns. He seems to bring out the best in his cinematographer, both for scenery and for his characters.\r\n\r\nIn one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn\u2019t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique.\r\n\r\nOn a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra. Check it out.\r\n\r\nSo the movie works for me on multiple levels, and I own a copy so I can watch it any time the mood strikes me",
            "There is one word to define The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And that word is \u201ctranscendent\u201d. This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It\u2019s safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the \u201cblack and white\u201d concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by the word \u201cepic\u201d.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. \u201cThe Bad\u201d, Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. \u201cThe Ugly\u201d, Tuco, is a  greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. \u201cThe Good\u201d, Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as \u201cThe Good\u201d right after abandoning a man to die in the desert.\r\n\t\r\nThe story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them.\r\n\t\r\nThe performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the \u201chero\u201d, Blondie.\r\n\t\r\nThe original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L\u2019estasi dell\u2019oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for almost seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art\u2019s history.\r\n\t\r\nAt the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It\u2019s a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It\u2019s a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. To conclude, all I can say is\u2026 There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who have watched this film, and those who have not. You watch.",
            "Solid western, which generally isn't a favorite genre of mine, with great performances and some well shot scenes and landscapes. Been a long time since I saw A Fistful of Dollars or For a Few Dollars More, but this is a great entry in the \"Man With No Name\" Trilogy. **4.0/5**",
            "Very good no doubt about it, even if I feel it's an odd fitting third installment of the Dollars trilogy.\r\n\r\nIn case this review sounds negative at any point, I wanna explicitly state for the avoidance of any doubt that <em>'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'</em> is very good! Any cons noted are relative.\r\n\r\nI just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of <em>'A Fistful of Dollars'</em> and <em>'For a Few Dollars More'</em>. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.\r\n\r\nThe man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.\r\n\r\nAs stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.\r\n\r\nMinus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.\r\n\r\n<em>watched: \"Extended English-language version\".<br>\r\nEven though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation? Odd.</em>",
            "Not as bad as the other Leone Westerns.\r\nStill, that is not saying much at all.\r\nAt 3/10, this is better than his totally ridiculous ones.\r\nIt's still a dull movie with non credible one dimensional characters who have no motivation for a single thing they do.\r\nThree homicidal maniacs who are called good, bad, and ugly, but really they're all just bad and ugly.\r\nEli Wallach steals the show. I think most people agree with me on that, and for some people he saves the show, but I need better writing, and more \"credible characters in incredible circumstances\" than we get with Leone.\r\nBlondie (Eastwood) kills anyone he sees in the wild. He kills other bounty hunters to steal their prisoner to bring in for rewards.\r\nIt's a good thing we didn't have Allied soldiers like Blondie, or else all Germans would have to do to win the war would be surrender and let American GIs kill each other to steal prisoners to bring in. Imagine that. We would have lost WW2 if our soldiers were like Blondie (or Manko, or whatever his name was).\r\nThe attempts to humanize the homicidal maniacs played by Clint and Eli only work for the brain dead idiots who buy into that. Such brain dead idiots don't last long in the hood or in volatile situations. Sadists do not get human. They only act human at times to get innocent victims to lower their guard.\r\nThe three man shootout at the end is stolen from the pair of movies \"The Jackal\" and \"Yellow Sky\", and I'm not sure if it's better or not. Neither one is in a top one hundred all time movie gunfights or showdowns. It's weak and stupid.\r\nBut when the spaghetti Westerns came out, the drug abusers and potheads loved them, and demanded they be acclaimed. The critics were either scared of the druggies or were druggies themselves, because the critics were bigger hacks than Leone for praising this garbage. \r\nHow long will we endure the crack head idolization of this garbage? Probably another 30 years or so, until we get some mature viewers who are willing to make up their own minds about what is classic, instead of being sheep.\r\nYep, Eli spoke of sheep in another Western, but it fits here.\r\nI give it a grade on a curb to make it 3/10, although compared to 1950s Westerns it is 1/10, but I'm lenient, because it isn't as bad as the other Leone Westerns. It isn't exactly \"watchable\", and you will fall asleep if you take it in one viewing, but the other Leone Westerns are even more boring than this one. Eli Wallach does do a great job, and for some people, that's enough.",
            "**One of the best, most famous and most iconic Westerns ever. More than a classic, it's mandatory.**\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. S\u00e9rgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.\r\n\r\nFor this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.\r\n\r\nThe film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that.",
            "People tended to treat Sergio Leone's work with a considerable degree of disdain, but watching this in 2020 it is still amongst the very best of the genre. A good-looking, calculating Clint Eastwood (\"The Good\"), is the itinerant bounty hunter who has an uneasy partnership with a scene-stealing Eli Wallach (\"The Ugly) to trick the local authorities of the reward money due for his capture before escaping and dividing the spoils. They happen upon a recently robbed stagecoach where they learn of the whereabout of a huge stash of gold - but they both possess different clues as to the location, so must - despite themselves - work together to track down the loot. Meantime, a thoroughly nasty Lee Van Cleef (\u201cThe Bad\") hears about their treasure hunt and is now joined in the race to the money. There is a paucity of dialogue that only enhances their performances - there are bouts of humour and although the premiss is pretty violent, there is actually very little by way of grisly, gory depiction seen on screen. The scene near the end in the graveyard with the magnificent Morricone \"Ecstacy of Gold\" theme is as good as Westerns get. The editing is not great, it has to be said - but the cinematography gives a great showcase to the scale and grandeur of the locations. Not a word I use often, but this really is a masterpiece of the cinema.",
            "When you have to shoot, shoot. Don\u2019t talk. 70% (ish) \r\n\r\n This is the third in a so-called \u2018trilogy\u2019, a framing which I expressed doubts about in my review for the second in the sequence, \u201cFor a few dollars more\u201d. So, from my perspective it\u2019s a matter of complete indifference as to how many in this \u2018trilogy\u2019 you see and in what order you watch them. That being said, if you watch all three films you will observe the tropes that are common to this \u2018trilogy\u2019. In this one the plot concerns three men on the make who end up chasing a fortune in gold during the American Civil War (American history is not my forte, so looking at Wikipedia for the span of this war, I\u2019d guess that it takes place towards the tail end of it, in the mid 1860s). The three men on the make are referred to in the film\u2019s title. Skim reading Wikipedia\u2019s entry for this film, there is an interesting thing to note about the title: \u201cIn the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to \"The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]\"\u201d. That quote misses \u2018the good one\u2019, which, in this case, is Clint Eastwood\u2019s character of \u2018Blondie\u2019. I\u2019m using scare quotes for his name because it\u2019s a nickname and also a trope of this trilogy, in that he always plays a character whose name we aren\u2019t sure of, whether we think we know it or not. Lee Van Cleef plays \u2018the ugly one\u2019 and Eli Wallach plays \u2018the bad one\u2019. \r\n\r\n \u201cThe good, the bad and the ugly\u201d returns to the opening title style of the first film, \u201cA fistful of dollars\u201d, initially, at least. Here you\u2019ll get Ennio Morricone\u2019s famous composition which is, musically, at least, his most accomplished, as in you\u2019d want to get the soundtrack for this film because it is so good as a piece of music (it\u2019s an earworm!). His score for the previous film worked better as a soundtrack for a film, as in it heightened tension or what have you. When Eastwood\u2019s character is revealed (or at least the back of his head, while he is smoking), that famous score plays. That seemed to tie it to him but it would later repeat for the character of Tuco. I\u2019m not sure what we are meant to glean from the fact that the phrase \u201cDirected by Sergio Leone\u201d is in three different fonts! The opening titles have a letterbox aspect which is dropped for the rest of the film, as was the case with the earlier films. \r\n\r\n Back to the tropes of this film, there is the visual style of Eastwood. It looked as though his stylistic trope of wearing a poncho would not occur in this film but it did towards the end. As I noted for Eastwood\u2019s character in the previous film, I would say the same thing about Lee Van Cleef\u2019s character for this one: he\u2019s not the same person in both films. Once again you eventually get something resembling a visual trope for him, after thinking it wouldn\u2019t occur: his pipe smoking. Lastly, going on the two previous films, you would expect there to be a main villain of the piece. Maybe I thought it was (or might be) Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 but he is \u2018replaced\u2019 by Eli Wallach. Wikipedia does mention that Volont\u00e9 was considered for the role but Leone wanted to cast someone who could add a different dimension to the character. Having him in all three films would have made for interesting processing of what this kind of casting means for the trilogy. In any case, perhaps it\u2019s a nice symmetry with Eastwood being the constant and Volont\u00e9 and Van Cleef being either side of the trilogy for two films. \r\n\r\n Some of the dialogue in this film did catch my attention, as it did in the first film. Both of these films would make good material for a high school subject like history or media studies or what have you. Amongst the meaty dialogue in this film are lines like: (an official reading the charges against a condemned man) \u201craping a virgin of the white race; statutory rape of a minor of the black race\u201d; a business man speaks of the Confederates: \u201cas soon as these cowards hear a blue shirt is around, they run. These rebels have no will to fight. They\u2019ll soon be finished. We get rid of these bastards, then we begin making money on those Yankees. They carry gold, not paper dollars and they\u2019re going to defeat the South\u201d; a Confederate sergeant says: \u201cthe only thing we care about is saving our own hides\u201d. \r\n\r\n In my reviews I\u2019ve noted the sense of humour of Eastwood\u2019s characters. In the first film it is playful. In the second it is guarded (maybe I should have used that word there!). Here it is cruel (in an early scene). This is just another demonstration to me that Eastwood is not playing the same character in all three films. Of all the three films, Eastwood\u2019s character is the most unpleasant here, which makes his designation as \u201cthe good\u201d (in a postmodern fashion by Leone, using on-screen text) as seemingly ironic. When he calls Tuco a \u201cgreasy rat\u201d, it makes me wonder if there is an ethnic dimension to the choice of villains in all three films. That might be a meta observation of the trilogy by me though. Some of the humour isn\u2019t intended as cruel though. For instance, there is a funny scene where \u2018Blondie\u2019 and Tuco wonder what side of the civil war an approaching cavalry is on. Another scene with Tuco, in a prison camp, brought to mind a scene in the film Pretty Woman, which was played for laughs. \u2018Blondie\u2019 is definitely a dodgy character and his scheme at the start of the film is novel (to me) although I do wonder about continuity errors as far as his partner in crime goes. Their seemingly first meeting doesn\u2019t really square with what happens later. How Blondie is seen to become partners in crime with this person also illustrates how odious his character is. \r\n\r\n Another major aspect of this film is its depiction of war. It made me question whether it was being used a prop. Is what the film saying about war merely glib? War isn\u2019t glorified here in any case. Perhaps it\u2019s not odd that I found some scenes of war being taken to a town had echoes in what is currently happening around the world. The makeup used to depict war injuries strikes me as having a realistic look to it. In a more oblique manner, I did note the use of targets in a shooting range looking like Native Americans. It\u2019s such a throwaway moment but it struck me, as did similar moments in the first film, concerning Native Americans. \r\n\r\n Of the three films in this \u2018trilogy\u2019, this is the one that I\u2019m scoring the lowest. All of the films had their moments which strained credulity or buggered belief. It\u2019s just that for this one, it really went beyond pushing the envelope for me. Even though Eastwood\u2019s character\u2019s entrance into the final showdown of the first film was unbelievable, I still found it satisfying for its mythic quality. This unbelievability just increases from film to film in an unsatisfying way. One example of that is the depiction of the captain at Branson Bridge. His behaviour just didn\u2019t seem grounded in reality. I\u2019m not including the fact that he looks swarthy, as do most of the soldiers on the Confederate side, for some reason. It was filmed in Europe, especially Spain, so I won\u2019t hold that against them. Generally speaking, I just didn\u2019t find the main characters believable in how they related to one another, given their history. As a side note, this film had a non-linear feel to it but I suppose that the ugly one\u2019s search for Carson is a thread. \r\n\r\n Of the \u2018trilogy\u2019, I\u2019d say that the first is the one that I\u2019d most likely revisit again sometime. The second one, maybe, after a long absence. The third film is much longer but it\u2019s not for that reason that it doesn\u2019t feel to me like something that I\u2019d be interested in revisiting, although it does have its moments. My thoughts on what I should score this range from 75% (no + sign meaning I give it 7 out of 10 stars on a site where you can\u2019t give half stars) to maybe 67.5% if I\u2019m feeling unaccommodating. 72.5% or 72.5+% isn\u2019t unreasonable but maybe I\u2019ll just stick to what this site gives me, 7 out 10 stars?\r\n\r\nRandom notes:\r\n\r\n^ I viewed the \u201cExtended English language version\u201d which had a \u201c2003 restoration and remastering\u201d. Recorded on 11/10/2024. SBS World Movies, 9:55pm. Running time of 2:51:15 without the six lots of ads during the film (measured from the start of the MGM lion\u2019s roar to to the end, being after the trademark still of the lion, which, for the first time, didn\u2019t have a lion\u2019s roar), which brings the running time up to 3:11:51. I must say that I appreciated the fact that SBS didn\u2019t play ads during the lead up to the ending (the last ad ended 2:26:04 on the unedited film). Audio Described and Closed Captions. It was rated M for adult themes and violence. I viewed this film over two days, from 23/11/2024 and made these notes. I started writing this review on 07/12/2024 up to here and a bit more. Another first for this trilogy is the inclusion of end credits.\r\n\r\n^ The option for Closed Captions was appreciated by me but I still found an online site with the script to refer to at times. SBS\u2019 captions (I presume it was theirs) were good. For instance, whilst the online site didn\u2019t include Spanish utterances, SBS\u2019 did and I got a strong language translation when I typed it into a translation app on my PC. Sometimes the online script had words which the CC didn\u2019t. Sometimes the online script had the right word and the CC didn\u2019t. \r\n\r\n^ Once again, I hear what sort of sounds like words in Morricone\u2019s score, in this case \u201cGo, go, go, echo\u201d. He has actually composed music which features lyrics for this film: \u201cThe story of a soldier\u201d and those lyrics were written by Tommie Connor. \r\n\r\n^ Not sure if Tuco\u2019s sign of the cross is correct...which might be the point, perhaps.\r\n\r\n^ Interesting casting for the first character we come across called \u201cShorty\u201d. I wonder what his story was. Wikipedia doesn\u2019t answer that question but interestingly I see that he is yet another actor who has appeared elsewhere in this trilogy...and you\u2019d think that I would have definitely remembered seeing him before!\r\n\r\n^ Lee Van Cleef seems to have at least one thing in common with Dave Allen...part of his finger is missing!\r\n\r\nAnyway, it\u2019s interesting that the film delays returning actor\u2019s props from the previous films in the trilogy: Eastwood starts out wearing a trench coat in this film before taking a poncho at the end (by the way, I liked the cinematography of that scene at the cemetery with Tuco) and Van Cleef is only later seen with a smoking pipe. This review submitted late 11/12/2024, AEST. \r\n\r\nP.S. Having now looked at the ponchos in all three films, it looks to me that they are the same. Now, maybe this style of poncho was ten a penny back in the day but it seems to me that this stylistic thread between all three films...and I'm not sure what it's meant to signify...because I'm not treating all the characters that Clint Eastwood plays as being the same person."

            "All what you can expect from a western.",
            "With apologies (not really) to fans who disagree, this is truly a classic western. I read a criticism that some scenes run long with agonizingly lengthy close-ups, but I found the cinematography intriguing. Those shots divulge nearly as much into the characters' personalities as a wad of dialogue from older traditional westerns. \r\n\r\nSometimes in a spaghetti western I find myself thinking, aw, why did that innocent person have to die, but innocents did die in the old west, I imagine. I am sure there was a lot of senseless violence then, just as there is now. And Bronson seemed like an odd choice as hero to me, though who can question a director who had the instinct to make perennial good guy Henry Fonda the ultimate villain? He didn't suck in this role, did he? And at least we get some back story with the harmonica playing Bronson character, unlike with old Blondie from Leone's The Good The Bad and the Ugly.\r\n\r\nAnd if you like the soundtrack, check out a YouTube video by The Danish National Symphony Orchestra And watch how they recreated the various parts of the music. It is pretty neat and just eight minutes long.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I think Once Upon a Time in the West is a western classic, a Greek tragedy with spurs. So shoot me (at ten paces).",
            "I can't say that this script doesn't play on Clint Eastwood's \"Man with No Name\" (which Sergio Leone also directed), but it's not important. If you're a spaghetti western fan, this film is a step up. The idea of putting Fonda in a bad guy role, and casting Bronson as anti-hero was a little shocking at first. At the end, I see how it worked to film's advantage by making all the characters more complex, ambiguous and real. If you were a Clint Eastwood, you'll love this film.",
            "The worst of the worst Leone Westerns.\r\nLeone destroyed the Westerns with his garbage, but the blame goes on to the critics who praised his lack of motivation, lack of inspiration, lack of credibility, lack of entertainment value, lack of strategy, just a total lack.\r\nThis is the worst of his stupid Westerns. It's the most contrived of his contrived Westerns.\r\nIt's another \"classical Greek hero\" story of gods, demigods, and cannon fodder. The more of a homicidal maniac you are, the more of a god you are. Great message.\r\nHere, we have a traditional Greek demigod hero who is out for revenge, the usual Hollywood formula.\r\nHe wants to kill Frank, whose only motivation is sadistic killing, because Fank killed his brother.\r\nSo, what does our traditional hero do? He kills everyone else but Frank, including men who are trying to kill Frank (Henry Fonda).\r\nI told you it was stupid, and that there was no way to buy into the motivation for the characters.\r\nThis one is the dumbest of the dumb Westerns. What's more, it's also worse because of all the waste. Why waste actors like Fonda, Robards, Bronson, Elam, and Strode on this stupid screenplay?",
            "**One of the great western movies.**\r\n\r\nWestern movies made in co-production by Italians and Americans (called \"spaghetti-western\") have been considered among the best that emerged within their genre, cleverly combining the tough action of Wild West gunslingers with the taste for raw realism and detail of the Italian filmmakers. I believe that such a thing may displease North Americans, who consider the cowboy a figure that is \"true USA\". I therefore invite them to visit the Brazilian city of Barretos, or the rural areas of Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso or Tocantins in Brazil. There are plenty of cowboys there\u2026 they just lack the guns.\r\n\r\nSergio Leone is an unavoidable figure here, having been responsible for the greatest \u201cspaghetti\u201d ever made. In this film, he gives us again a remarkable job, full of qualities. I don't consider it the best of his career or the best \"spaghetti western\" ever made, but it definitely has a place on the podium. The film begins very well, with the massacre of an Irish immigrant and his family, which leaves in the hands of a second wife \u2013 yes, the man was secretly a bigamist \u2013 a few acres of uninteresting desert... but there are people willing to kill for it. It happens that the smart Irishman had bought the only viable land for the railroad, and had even acquired the right to build a station and a new settlement! In the middle, we still have a gunslinger in search of personal revenge and another, in the pay of the railroad itself.\r\n\r\nLet's face things frankly: the movie is good. It's a classic in its own right, almost mandatory for any movie lover, which doesn't mean that it's mandatory to like it! It is not a perfect film, it has problems that we will talk about, but it is equally endowed with characteristics and qualities that deserve to be valued.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is very elegant, with good light and color. The sets and costumes are beautiful, even if it is frankly difficult to set a date to the film. In addition to the fact that the script does not establish a rigorous chronology, it's clear that the concern of the production designer and costume designers was aesthetics rather than historical rigor because there is a mixture of props, clothing and objects from the 1870s, 1880s and 1860. Is it a minor problem? Yes, but it is still a problem and a sign of the carelessness with which many productions are still facing historical rigor nowadays. The visual and special effects are put to good use and the soundtrack, atmospheric and truly impactful, is one of Ennio Morricone's most powerful works. Unfortunately, the film's editing was not the best, with cuts so abrupt and violent that it almost leads one to believe that the film was cut \"a posteriori\" for some reason. And perhaps the biggest problem turns out to be its excessively slow and annoying construction, with each scene lasting three minutes longer than necessary and the general length reaching three hours unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nWe can only say good things about the cast: among a vast succession of unknown and unimportant Italians, there are some outstanding actors who do not disappoint us and give us magnificent interpretations. Charles Bronson is a good-hearted tough guy with a monstrous charisma that steals our attention whenever he appears. Henry Fonda is effective as a villain, showing the actor's enormous versatility. Claudia Cardinale, one of the muses of cinema at the time, combines an impressive resilience of spirit, a high dose of charisma and a beauty that is still remembered today. Jason Robards has the difficult task of being the helpful good guy who ends badly to glorify the hero, but he takes the opportunity to show all his value as an actor.",
            "Great western that I never watched despite owning the old DVD, but with Paramount releasing this on 4K UHD, decided to sit down through the 165-minute duration and it was a wonderful experience. Great performances all around, but most notably Jason Robards and Charles Bronson. Just another homerun from Sergio Leone though I think I prefer \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" but it's close. **4.5/5**"

            "Funny child acting, nonsense sense of distance, bad dubbing and weak dialogue bring down an otherwise magnificent film. A Western remake of Yojimbo, it's remarkable how such a simple story can lend itself to such a great experience. The atmosphere is built up masterfully - with stunning cinematography, striking close-ups, beautifully constructed mise-en-scene, a fantastic performance from Eastwood, Moricone's ever powerful music, and a lovely overabundance of laughing - all culminating in one of the best showdowns in cinematic history.",
            "Even better than I remember. The story was more interesting than I remembered. The Man With No Name is more fun in this movie than I remembered. The side characters are more interesting than I remembered. My only complaints are that some of the acting and parts of the script could be better. This is really epic movie that I would not mind watching again!",
            "A supremely entertaining western from 1964!\r\n\r\nI will say the dubbing nature of <em>'A Fistful of Dollars'</em> is a little distracting early on, but by the time the opening portion concluded I was incredibly interested in what was happening onscreen. The pacing is excellent, thanks to some very fine cinematography, great action sequences and a top notch score.\r\n\r\nClint Westwood debuts as a leading movie star and is terrific throughout, portraying the wonderfully named J\u0336o\u0336e\u0336 \"the Man with No Name\". It's little surprise these are the films that truly made him. Away from Eastwood, I really enjoyed the trio that played the Rojo brothers - Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 (aka Johnny Wels), Sieghardt Rupp and Antonio Prieto. They're just as important as the main man and play the roles superbly.\r\n\r\nBring on the sequels!",
            "Leone almost single handedly destroyed the Western.\r\nBut it wasn't \"single handed\" because he had help from the critics who were even bigger hacks than Leone was.\r\nHere, we have a movie based on Yojimbo, which is called a classic by some, though I doubt it is truly a classic. \"Seven Samurai\" is a classic, but not \"Yojimbo\". \r\nStill, \"Yojimbo\" is better than this, because too much is lost in translation here.\r\nIt's a thoroughly unmotivated movie about totally unmotivated characters. \r\nThe only interesting bit in here is a quip about the equine that No Name (Eastwood) rides. \r\nWell, that's because the equine is the ONLY interesting and credible character in the entire movie.\r\nSomehow, No Name thinks he can massacre what appears to be at least fifty gunmen without a scratch, yet he says at the end he doesn't take risks.\r\nIt's just a bunch of killing and shooting and noise with no motivation. For \"bang per buck\", it's one of the poorest payoffs ever. Only \"The Wild Bunch\" scores a worse \"bang per buck\" than this with its dullness for all the gun play.\r\nWhen the dollar trilogy came out, only the crack heads and total dope heads thought it was cool, so the critics placated them. Now, those people are in authority, God help us, and have fooled following generations into the idea that this garbage is \"classic\". Talk about the emperor's new clothes, we see it illustrated here.",
            "With barely enough cash to buy a drink, drifter \"Joe\" (Clint Eastwood) rides into a small, pretty war-torn town near the US/Mexican border. He makes friends with the bar owner \"Silvanito\" (Jos\u00e9 Calvo) and pretty quickly finds himself drawn into the brutal quarrelling between \"Baxter\" (Wolfgang Lukschy) and his nemesis \"Rojo\" (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9). When he kills a few of the former man's troops, it's the brother of the latter who offers him a job. Turns out that \"Joe\" is a bit more shrewd than that though, and so he decides that the best solution is the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend - he can divide, sit it out a bit, and conquer - with considerable riches to be gained if his admittedly quite dangerous manipulation can succeed. Clint Eastwood is a fine exponent of the less is more style of acting. His expressions, his eyes, even his distinctive gait allow the character to develop effortlessly as this story takes a route that isn't as predictable (or easy) as you might expect. The supporting cast also work well to epitomise a small-town, brutal and venal mentality with plenty of action and hysterical laughter to keep the story moving along to a classic Morricone score set amongst the grubby and basic adobe homes. Sergio Leone does not feel the need to drag this out for hours - it's an almost perfectly paced piece of nasty, gripping, cinema that is really well worth a watch on a big screen if you can.",
            "A fistful of dollars A very tasty spaghetti Western. 80% \r\n\r\nA lone white man riding on horseback slowly approaches a well near a couple of isolated homes, in order to drink some water. He observes a little boy running between the two homes and then entering one. The little boy is unceremoniously ejected from the home by two non-white men with pistols. You can tell that they are bad men because they shoot bullets next to the boy in order to scare him. A young woman, perhaps the boy's mother, looks on anxiously. The little boy runs to the other house and calls out \"Papa!\" to the man who comes out of that house. The bad men then proceed to physically assault the father. The bad men observe the lone white man but ignore him. The lone white man makes eye contact with the young woman and gives a gentle smile to her, without opening his lips. She slams her wooden window shut, which has bars in front of it. He moves on to some other place.\r\n\r\nNext stop for our lone rider is a town. He is approached by the town's bell ringer, who informs him \"everybody here has become very rich or else they are dead...You will get rich here or you'll be killed\". This he says after helpfully mentioning (to both the viewer and the unnamed white man) a couple of important surnames in this town, Rojo and Baxter. As the lone rider proceeds down the dirt street in the town, the residents in their homes peek anxiously through their curtains to watch him. It's a town in fear. Next in the street are some white looking men (their accents would suggest a different ethnicity but that's probably just dubbing, perhaps?) armed with pistols who proceed to fire bullets next to his horse in order to run him out of town. However, our protagonist decides to 'hang around', so to speak, in one of a few comical moments in this film.\r\n\r\nNeeding much more exposition, we are introduced to the owner of the town's cantina. Again, names aren't really used in this film. The cantina owner asks our protagonist what he wants in this town. \"Food and something to drink\" he says, to which the cantina owner replies \"Eating and drinking and killing. That's all you can do, just like the rest of your kind\". They've only just met and already with the assumptions! He goes on to say: \"if you don't mind doing a little killing, you will have no trouble finding someone eager to pay you\".\r\n\r\nLater in the conversation we finally learn of the town's name from the cantina owner. It's San Miguel. Maybe it's a fictional town but the Wikipedia entry for this film says that in the film, it's on the border of Mexico and the US. When the lone rider says to the cantina owner \"Any town that sells guns and liquor has gotta be a rich one\" we get the big dose of juicy exposition needed from the cantina owner, who informs us that \"Not the town, only those who buy and sell, and the bosses are the ones who clean up...but when there are two around, then I'd say that there is one too many\". This brings us back to the names mentioned by the town's bell ringer: Rojo and Baxter. Our well of exposition, the cantina owner, says: \"The Rojos boys, three brothers who sell liquor. And then there's the Baxters, big gun merchants. If I'm not mistaken, you already met Baxter's gang, didn't you?\". After referring to our protagonist's horse as a \"mule\", the cantina owner learns that our interloper sees his position thus: \"Me right in the middle\". Cantina owner: \"Where you do what?\". Interloper: \"Crazy bell ringer was right. There's money to be made in a place like this\". This said after the cantina owner has told him of the two gangs that \"They've enlisted all the scum that hangs around both sides of the frontier, and they pay in dollars\".\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much as much of the plot that I want to tell you. Much later in the film, the coffin maker/undertaker refers to our protagonist as \"Joe\". It struck me that either the undertaker just called him that or our protagonist did tell him his real name...or just created one to tell the undertaker. Anyway, \"Joe\" asks the cantina owner which of the two gangs is the stronger then soon after bumps into the head of the Baxter gang, John Baxter, who is, ironically...the town's sheriff! How will all this play out? Watch the film to find out, obviously...but maybe the cantina owner was perceptive, because later on in the film, \"Joe\" informs him that \"The dead can be very useful sometimes. They've helped me out of tough spots more than once\". Hmm. What on Earth?\r\n\r\nDespite being a mysterious figure, \"Joe\" does reveal some titbits about himself (perhaps), which might explain his character or why he does things. On one occasion he says \"I never found home that great\" and on another occasion, when asked why he would help a woman, he responds \"Why? I knew someone like you once. There was no one there to help\".\r\n\r\nRandom observations:\r\n\r\n^ I did have a preconception that the protagonist of this film would be a godlike figure and that is sort of confirmed in the film. At one point \"Joe\" says (on the 1st floor balcony of the cantina) \"Things always look different from higher up\". Ram\u00f3n Rojo at another point says \"I don't like that Americano. He's too smart to be just a hired fighter\".\r\n\r\n^ The version of this film which I watched was screened on SBS World Movies in Australia, on 09/10/2024, at 9:30pm and I watched it over two days from 09/11/2024...because the lack of subtitles meant that I had to grind through the film, replaying bits to work out what was being said, or reading an online transcript. That was really disappointing and in other circumstances I would have deleted the film without watching it but I persevered and did find it rewarding for it's narrative engagement. After removing the ads, the length of the film was about 1:35:48 long, from the start of the MGM lion's raw at the beginning to its end at the end. The four lots of ads had a sum total of 16 minutes and 26 seconds. \r\n\r\n^ SBS had a rating of the film of MA15+ which I didn't feel was justified for the most part. To explain that, there's a scene where the cantina owner says to \"Joe\" the following: \"It's like playing cowboys and Indians\". That comment struck me as being a bit meta. As a film made in 1964, maybe it was violent for its time but now? There was no realism to the gun violence. There was no blood, really. It was really only for the fist fight that the no doubt primitive make-up got quite gruesome and warranted such a rating. It's the art of this film that even though the physical violence isn't particularly realistic and the blood looks fake (more like paint), the scene evokes gruelling punishment.\r\n\r\n^ It's not clear to me that the director of the film, Sergio Leone, has done anything other than re-present America back to itself in a way which accords with its own self-perception. There are mere glimpses of a story which would deconstruct that self-mythologising...the cantina owner on who visits San Miguel: \"Bandits and smugglers. They come down from Texas. They cross the frontier to stock up on guns and liquor. The cost is much less here. Then they go back and sell the guns and liquor to the Indians\"...and lastly, when \"Joe\" says to the cantina owner (later identified as \"Silvanito\") \"Well, guess your government will be glad to see that gold back\". Now, my history isn't the best but...'Mexico's' gold? Yes, we have here a case of a tale of two colonising societies and only allusions to the victims of that.\r\n\r\n^ There is an ecstatic element to the bloodlust of the Mexicans towards the end of the film.\r\n\r\n^ Even though this film was, in a way, \"playing cowboys and Indians\", I really enjoyed the engaging narrative. Whilst the lead up to the resolution of the conflict wasn't logical, it charmed me with its mythic quality...a quality that Americans would, no doubt, love to see about themselves.\r\n\r\n^ In what seems like a continuity error, the bullet holes in the poncho don't match to what was underneath...I happened to pause my PVR at this point, randomly, so I just followed through with that.\r\n\r\n^ There are only credits at the start of the film. There is something akin to the James Bond gun barrel sequence in the animated opening sequence. I wondered if Ennio Morricone wrote the score...it sounded a bit like him. The credits list Dan Savio as the composer but luckily Wikipedia lists Ennio Morricone as the real name of the composer. A part of his score at the start of the film reminded me of something...maybe it was \"When Johnny comes marching home\"...or maybe it wasn't. There is some vocalisation in the score and it seemed to me as if the words were \"We can fight!\" but maybe there were no actual words used.\r\n\r\n^ If Clint Eastwood has ever had the nickname \"Squint\", then a scene about 53:19 minutes in would be a good example of why that was the case. When did he first start squinting? On television first?\r\n\r\n^ The scene with the armoured suit made me think it would be relevant at a later point...it didn't in a way that they thought that it might. In any case, there are some nice callbacks in the dialogue to other events in the film. \r\n\r\n^ I was thinking of giving this film 7 stars out of 10 on this site with an actual score of 75% (I round down the stars on this site) but the storytelling was so engaging and the mythic elements pleasing enough for me to bump up my score despite the inexplicable lack of subtitles for this broadcast affecting how I consumed this film."

            "I was worried about you - all alone, with so many problems to solve...\r\n\r\nThe middle part of Sergio Leone's dollars trilogy sandwich is a mighty hunk of meat and pasta. Plot has Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as bounty hunters who form a very uneasy alliance to bring down violent bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) and his gang.\r\n\r\nAs befitting Leone in this sub-genre, the pic positively oozes charisma and class. His compositions are as striking as the coolness he wrings out from his lead actors, the characterisations bristling with a calm grizzle factor that beguiles as the story jumps from violence to suspense, from humour to misery, with surprises is store as well. The screenplay adheres to some clich\u00e9s of the Western formula, but never at a cost to suspense and mystery, such as with the finale that looks set to be formulaic, but joyfully brings its own identity whilst simultaneously adding extra layers to the protags and antag. The dialogue (Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni) pings with literacy, something which is a pleasant mercy in the Spaghetti Western world, while Morricone fills the key scenes with aural shards of atmospheric delight.\r\n\r\nA great film in its own standalone right, but also a super precursor to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 9/10",
            "I'd rank it slightly below the original, but that's unimportant as <em>'For a Few Dollars More'</em> is still a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nClint Eastwood is tremendous again as the lead character, while Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 reappears as a different character - usually I'm not a fan of actors playing different characters in a series, but I must make an exception here as Volont\u00e9 is terrific; just as he is in the preceding 1964 film. One newcomer to the cast is Lee Van Cleef, who is brilliant too.\r\n\r\nA story regarding bounty hunting was always going to be enjoyable, which is most definitely the case here. The aforementioned trio are massively entertaining. I particularly found the ending to be one of the best parts of this.\r\n\r\nI was excited to check out <em>'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'</em> even prior to watching the first two films, given it's the one I knew most of beforehand, but its two predecessors really have wet the appetite and then some!",
            "This is a waste of some wit.\r\nOf the dollar trilogy, this one had some wit to it, but it's wasted. There's an ongoing weird counting that the bounty hunters perform, which finally makes sense in the end.\r\nThere's an interesting bit about the chimes, and drawing when the chime ends.\r\nAnd we get a name for No Name.\r\nBut it's wasted on a movie that Leone made during what must have been the days when he really hated some brunette who scorned him. He spends most of the movie contriving so many ways to kill brunettes that he obviously is seeking a Nazi merit badge. He stopped worshiping Adolf and Eva soon after the dollar trilogy, though.\r\nThere's no way to get past his Nazi ideology in this movie, and it ruins the movie.\r\nNot to mention the lack of credible characters and lack of credible motivation. Again, it's a case of everyone in the West is either a homicidal maniac or the first victims of homicidal maniacs, no exceptions.\r\nThe weakest part, and part that makes anyone with an IQ over 15 groan, is that Leone is not subtle about his message that the more of a homicidal maniac a man is, the more of a demigod he is, and more immortal he is. \r\nOnly another demigod can kill a demigod, and only a homicidal maniac can be a demigod. It appears the only way to be a god is to be the biggest homicidal maniac.\r\nIf everyone was like this, there would be no one left to be like this.\r\nA waste of wit, which is bad, because this is the only one of the Leone Westerns which made any attempt at wit.",
            "\"El Indio\" (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) is a bank robber being hunted by poncho-clad bounty hunter Clint Eastwood \"Manco\". Lee van Cleef (\"Col. Mortimer\") is also on the trail of our bandito and his gang, so the unlikely pair form an uneasy partnership in order to track him down and share the bounty. This most certainly ain't a film about trust - it's about greed, pure and simple and is great! It\u2019s a bit of a slow burn - nothing happens very quickly, but that all adds bundles to the atmosphere and tension of the story. That said, it sure isn't dull: there is still plenty of gun fighting, fisticuffs and general nastiness as well as some clever, black, humour and a wonderfully rousing score from Ennio Morricone that gets us to the inevitable series of crosses, double and even triple crosses. I don't think it has quite the menace or grittiness of \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) but it's is still a tautly directed, character-driven western with a plot riddled with twists.",
            "A spaghetti Cornetto trilogy? 75+%\r\n\r\n A lone man on horseback is seen travelling slowly towards us from a distance. Soon there is a seemingly senseless act of violence. It isn\u2019t clear to me whether this \u2018loose end\u2019 is resolved later on in the film or whether it mainly functions as worldbuilding, for the benefit of the viewer, letting them know how little value human lives have in this place.\r\n\r\n After the opening credits follow on from this, the film proper begins. We see two men in a train carriage. The face of one is obscured as they are reading the Holy Bible, according to the text on it. We come to know the man with the obscured face as the film unreels. Not really having read any reviews or such like of this film, I wonder if I am the only person to ponder at the end of this man\u2019s journey whether that introduction to him was in earnest or ironic. It\u2019s perhaps hard to tell. After all, Americans see no tension between loving Jesus and loving money, as the \u2018prosperity gospel\u2019 theology attests. \r\n\r\n The main story concerns two independent bounty hunters in America\u2019s frontier, near Mexico. There is uncertainty as to how the two bounty hunters (the film uses the term \u201cbounty killer\u201d) chasing the same bounties will play out. Is conflict inevitable between them? We have a sense of when all this action takes place, as, at a later point in the film, one of the minor characters is part of a humorous scene where we can see the disruptive influence of the recently introduced passenger train service to the region. \r\n\r\n The early action of the film put in mind video games for me, with how some action games might have small bounties for the player to chase when they first start and increasing in size as the gamer becomes more proficient at taking on their targets and seeks larger rewards to gain better equipment or what have you. As the bounties in the film increase in size, they seem to correlate with \u201con rails\u201d video games. In other words, I found this film to have more of a sense of linearity to it than its predecessor, \u201cA fistful of dollars\u201d. \r\n\r\n One of the bounty killers looks familiar for those who have seen \u201cA fistful of dollars\u201d. It\u2019s the character played by Clint Eastwood. So, obviously, there is a physical resemblance of the two characters and perhaps they even dress identically. However, to me they seemed two different characters, as in it\u2019s not the same person. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier film, Eastwood\u2019s character had a playful aspect to him there. In this next film in the sequence, though Eastwood\u2019s character is not exactly humourless, his humour is more wry or sardonic. No, that doesn\u2019t quite capture what I\u2019m wanting to say here. In the first film, \u2018Squint\u2019 Eastwood was playful and he shared that quality with at least one other character (I have in mind the \u2018hanging around\u2019 scene), whereas in this film Eastwood\u2019s character plays his cards held tightly to his chest. In other words, he is amused by some things but is not letting on to anyone else that he is (I have in mind the scene I mentioned earlier, with the minor character talking about the impact of the introduction of trains on him). \r\n\r\n Wikipedia mentions these first two films being part of a trilogy: \u201cThe dollars trilogy\u201d or \u201cThe man with no name trilogy\u201d. Since I don\u2019t find myself considering the Clint Eastwood character in both films that I\u2019ve seen so far to be the same person, I\u2019m leaning towards taking these films as being like \u201cThe Cornetto trilogy\u201d, in that they are three unrelated films with the same principle actors and loosely bound together. I have to admit to being totally clueless about this \u201cCornetto trilogy\u201d, despite having seen the first two: \u201cShaun of the dead\u201d and \u201cHot fuzz\u201d. Apparently all three films make passing mention of Cornetto ice creams. That is what makes them a \u2018trilogy\u2019. Perhaps Clint Eastwood\u2019s poncho is Sergio Leone\u2019s Cornetto counterpart? Maybe the third film in this \u2018trilogy\u2019 will prove me wrong but it doesn\u2019t seem a \u201ctrilogy\u201d at the moment like the Star Wars films are. \r\n\r\n An interesting facet to these first two films of the \u2018trilogy\u2019 that I have seen so far is how one is supposed to relate to returning actors. As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m viewing Clint Eastwood\u2019s characters as being different. Another returning actor is Gian Maria Volont\u00e9, who once again plays the principle villain of the piece, although he is clearly a different character in both. He must necessarily, of course, be of the same ethnicity. In any case, we have two archetypes in common for both films: the poncho wearing man with no name and the swarthy villain. An action archetype in both films is a scene with a beating, although the one in the first film was the more brutal, I think. The only other returning actor that I noticed was Joseph Egger. Since this paragraph and below was written a couple of weeks after I started this review, things like this aren\u2019t fresh in my memory, unfortunately. \r\n\r\n Speaking of men with no name, in this film, \u2018Squint\u2019 Eastwood\u2019s character is referred to as \u201cManco\u201d and it seemed to be an actual name to me. The translation app on my PC translates this variously as \u201cone-armed\u201d (for Spanish and Italian) or \u201cnot even\u201d (for Latin). Not sure how good my translation app is but it\u2019s not really clear to me how Clint\u2019s character is \u201cone-armed\u201d. \r\n\r\n When the film concludes, there is a sort of \u2018maybe, kind of, not really\u2019 ambiguity to it. There probably really isn\u2019t, as far as what that character would do in that situation, after retrieving a certain item.

This film has more implausibility to it than the first film which makes it harder for me to get lost in the story. The main way this is demonstrated is how characters interact with each other. I couldn\u2019t believe that Manco would accept a proposition from his rival to do something, as that set off alarm bells for me, as far as possible double-crosses go. Likewise, Manco getting accepted for a heist.

As far as dramatic music goes, this feels his best score so far, especially effective with the percussive textures during the El Paso bank robbery scene. One thing niggling at me is that I can\u2019t place what other piece of music some parts reminded me of. A few notes perhaps put in mind some 1960\u2019s surf-rock song...maybe something by The Shadows but maybe something else which I can\u2019t recall at the moment (the scene leading up to the bank robbery). A flashback scene has some eerie music. After the robbery scene, I wonder whether I hear the words \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d as part of the score...it sort of sounds like words are being used but maybe they\u2019re just meant to be suggestive vocalisations? More toward the start of the film, it sounds like the vocalisations are \u201cWe can ride!\u201d.\r\n\r\n* There is an odd mix of childlike depictions of violence (which are perhaps more Classical Hollywood Western in style, although I have not seen too many of these and not since I was a child in any case) and more realistic depictions of the consequences of violence. So, you will see a man fall to the ground after being shot but the shooter\u2019s gun was facing toward the ground, not the victim. And the victim does not bleed. On the other hand, on very rare occasions you will see graphic bullet wounds in freshly made corpses. It therefore seems like a transitional moment in cinema between these two styles...sort of like The Wizard Of Oz was for black/white and colour films, perhaps.\r\n\r\n* There\u2019s a scene where Manco forces an occupant of a hotel room to leave, so that he can have that room for himself. For me, this reflected badly on his character.\r\n\r\n* Architecture...when Indio\u2019s gang enters El Paso, one of the first buildings looks like a prop, as far as the first storey goes. The \u201cCosmopolitan Theatre\u201d has the UK spelling convention. Of more interest, it looked to me like a heavily secured internal section of the El Paso bank had an unsecured window at its heart...but maybe we can rationalise this by thinking that the bank is as weird as The Overlook Hotel in Kubrick\u2019s film The Shining? One shot of a town\u2019s main street made me wonder if it was shot in a studio, probably due to weather effects. \r\n\r\n* The fight scene between two bounty hunters is very formal, stylised and ritualistic. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that! This contrasts with another scene in the film which put in mind Jon Pertwee era Doctor Who fight scenes, with the Doctor\u2019s risible \u2018Venusian karate\u2019 (just looked that up for the term.

            "A spaghetti Cornetto trilogy? 75+%\r\n\r\n A lone man on horseback is seen travelling slowly towards us from a distance. Soon there is a seemingly senseless act of violence. It isn\u2019t clear to me whether this \u2018loose end\u2019 is resolved later on in the film or whether it mainly functions as worldbuilding, for the benefit of the viewer, letting them know how little value human lives have in this place.\r\n\r\n After the opening credits follow on from this, the film proper begins. We see two men in a train carriage. The face of one is obscured as they are reading the Holy Bible, according to the text on it. We come to know the man with the obscured face as the film unreels. Not really having read any reviews or such like of this film, I wonder if I am the only person to ponder at the end of this man\u2019s journey whether that introduction to him was in earnest or ironic. It\u2019s perhaps hard to tell. After all, Americans see no tension between loving Jesus and loving money, as the \u2018prosperity gospel\u2019 theology attests. \r\n\r\n The main story concerns two independent bounty hunters in America\u2019s frontier, near Mexico. There is uncertainty as to how the two bounty hunters (the film uses the term \u201cbounty killer\u201d) chasing the same bounties will play out. Is conflict inevitable between them? We have a sense of when all this action takes place, as, at a later point in the film, one of the minor characters is part of a humorous scene where we can see the disruptive influence of the recently introduced passenger train service to the region. \r\n\r\n The early action of the film put in mind video games for me, with how some action games might have small bounties for the player to chase when they first start and increasing in size as the gamer becomes more proficient at taking on their targets and seeks larger rewards to gain better equipment or what have you. As the bounties in the film increase in size, they seem to correlate with \u201con rails\u201d video games. In other words, I found this film to have more of a sense of linearity to it than its predecessor, \u201cA fistful of dollars\u201d. \r\n\r\n One of the bounty killers looks familiar for those who have seen \u201cA fistful of dollars\u201d. It\u2019s the character played by Clint Eastwood. So, obviously, there is a physical resemblance of the two characters and perhaps they even dress identically. However, to me they seemed two different characters, as in it\u2019s not the same person. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier film, Eastwood\u2019s character had a playful aspect to him there. In this next film in the sequence, though Eastwood\u2019s character is not exactly humourless, his humour is more wry or sardonic. No, that doesn\u2019t quite capture what I\u2019m wanting to say here. In the first film, \u2018Squint\u2019 Eastwood was playful and he shared that quality with at least one other character (I have in mind the \u2018hanging around\u2019 scene), whereas in this film Eastwood\u2019s character plays his cards held tightly to his chest. In other words, he is amused by some things but is not letting on to anyone else that he is (I have in mind the scene I mentioned earlier, with the minor character talking about the impact of the introduction of trains on him). \r\n\r\n Wikipedia mentions these first two films being part of a trilogy: \u201cThe dollars trilogy\u201d or \u201cThe man with no name trilogy\u201d. Since I don\u2019t find myself considering the Clint Eastwood character in both films that I\u2019ve seen so far to be the same person, I\u2019m leaning towards taking these films as being like \u201cThe Cornetto trilogy\u201d, in that they are three unrelated films with the same principle actors and loosely bound together. I have to admit to being totally clueless about this \u201cCornetto trilogy\u201d, despite having seen the first two: \u201cShaun of the dead\u201d and \u201cHot fuzz\u201d. Apparently all three films make passing mention of Cornetto ice creams. That is what makes them a \u2018trilogy\u2019. Perhaps Clint Eastwood\u2019s poncho is Sergio Leone\u2019s Cornetto counterpart? Maybe the third film in this \u2018trilogy\u2019 will prove me wrong but it doesn\u2019t seem a \u201ctrilogy\u201d at the moment like the Star Wars films are. \r\n\r\n An interesting facet to these first two films of the \u2018trilogy\u2019 that I have seen so far is how one is supposed to relate to returning actors. As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m viewing Clint Eastwood\u2019s characters as being different. Another returning actor is Gian Maria Volont\u00e9, who once again plays the principle villain of the piece, although he is clearly a different character in both. He must necessarily, of course, be of the same ethnicity. In any case, we have two archetypes in common for both films: the poncho wearing man with no name and the swarthy villain. An action archetype in both films is a scene with a beating, although the one in the first film was the more brutal, I think. The only other returning actor that I noticed was Joseph Egger. Since this paragraph and below was written a couple of weeks after I started this review, things like this aren\u2019t fresh in my memory, unfortunately. \r\n\r\n Speaking of men with no name, in this film, \u2018Squint\u2019 Eastwood\u2019s character is referred to as \u201cManco\u201d and it seemed to be an actual name to me. The translation app on my PC translates this variously as \u201cone-armed\u201d (for Spanish and Italian) or \u201cnot even\u201d (for Latin). Not sure how good my translation app is but it\u2019s not really clear to me how Clint\u2019s character is \u201cone-armed\u201d. \r\n\r\n When the film concludes, there is a sort of \u2018maybe, kind of, not really\u2019 ambiguity to it. There probably really isn\u2019t, as far as what that character would do in that situation, after retrieving a certain item. It\u2019s just good that the film ends there and you are free to ponder what that character will do with that item.\r\n\r\nRandom notes:\r\n\r\n^ I\u2019m scoring this film 75+% (since I don\u2019t round up, the + sign adds an extra star to my rating here).

            "Django, you drag your coffin around, coffin around, coffin around. \r\n\r\nDjango is directed by Sergio Corbucci and it stars Franco Nero, Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo, Loredana Nusciak, \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez and Eduardo Fajardo. \r\n\r\nDjango (Nero), dragging a coffin behind him, saves a woman from some bandits and soon finds himself in the middle of war between two factions - which he may be able to use to his advantage. \r\n\r\n1966 was a stellar year for Spaghetti Westerns, Leone was putting the crown on his \"Dollars\" trilogy, Damiani produced a political firecracker and Sollima crafted one of the finest \"manhunt\" Oaters of this sub-genre. Then there is this, Django, a Pasta Western that is synonymous with the form. \r\n\r\nI fought for the North! \r\n\r\nDjango is a treat, it's violent and cruel, funny and cheeky, and pleasing on the eyes and ears - so pretty much it contains all the best things that made the original wave of Spaghetti's so palatable. Undeniably it owes a \"lot\" to A Fistful of Dollars and Yojimbo, but it's still its own beast, a baroque Gothic piece of work that positively revels in nihilism. The graphic violence is wonderfully cartoonish, the iconography unbound, and in Nero - eyes likes chips of ice - the pic has one of the coolest and baddest men on the planet. Nusciak brings the sex and sizzle, coming off like a Spag Raquel Welch, whilst the villains are delightfully vile and scuzzy. \r\n\r\nThe setting is superb, a muddy cold hell of a town with a brothel as the fulcrum of the piece. Naturally there's a cemetery, which will play host to some of that iconography mentioned earlier. Religion gets short shrift, racial prejudice given a caustic once over, while it's worth mentioning there's more than a hint of social realism pulsing away as Corbucci brings the blood and thunder. OK! It's light in plotting, and it's not even Corbucci's best film, but the stylised violence, the visuals and a cracking soundtrack easily take you away from the fodder of the story. \r\n\r\nIt would spawn a multitude of rip-offs, name checks and influence a whole host of film makers, but this is the real deal. A Spag Western worth revisiting to see just when it was a sub-genre of quality, this before hundreds of poor band wagon jumpers began to soil the Spaghetti Western name. 8.5/10",
            "***Cult Spaghetti Western with Django dragging his coffin***\r\n\r\nA mysterious stranger dragging a coffin (Franco Nero) saves a prostitute named Maria (Loredana Nusciak) and waltzes into a neutral border town that services both a private militia of ex-Rebels led by Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and a small army of Mexican revolutionaries, led by General Hugo (Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo). Meanwhile there\u2019s gold to be had.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1966, \u201cDjango\u201d (pronounced JANG-oh) is a cult Euro Western highlighted by its star and the typical cartoonish flourishes of the genre. Franco Nero and his Spaghetti Western lookalike, Terence Hill, represented the Euro-version of Clint Eastwood. To be expected, the characters are cardboard caricatures and there\u2019s a lot of brutal violence that\u2019s so sadistic and overdone it\u2019s comical.\r\n\r\nFor instance, 15 men are dead by the 20 minute mark with 40 more shortly later in a machine gun bloodbath. A mere half hour later there\u2019s a second machine gun assault lacking any artistic finesse whatsoever. It has to be seen to be believed and bespeaks of moviemaking for 13 year-olds. \r\n\r\nConsidering what\u2019s in Django\u2019s coffin, the way he drags it around isn\u2019t practical for more than 100 yards. The manner he awkwardly slogs it about is especially incredulous during the gold theft sequence where, curiously, no one sees or hears him. _Why Sure!_        \r\n\r\nWhen do these events take place? The death date on Mercedes Zaro\u2019s tombstone says 1889, which is substantiated by the use of the standard lever-action rifles and Django\u2019s quasi-Maxim machine gun, pointing to no earlier than 1884.\r\n\r\nTarantino took elements of \u201cDjango\u201d and other Spag Westerns to forge the outstanding \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d (2012), which makes \u201cDjango\u201d & most Euro Westerns of the 60s and early 70s pale by comparison. The title song by Luis Bacalov is good though and Nusciak is striking in an icy way.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes (with censored versions running 3-4 minutes less) and was shot in Madrid, Spain, and Lazio, Italy.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C",
            "\u201cDjango, have you always been alone?\u201d The song, written by Luis Bacalov and performed by Rocky Roberts, ponders, as an unknown man drags a coffin through the mud. That man is Django, a gunslinger who would go on to define a genre, and the protagonist of a gritty, violent and outrageously fun film. A man to respect, that is for sure.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by Sergio Corbucci, the same artist responsible for classics such as Navajo Joe (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), the film is one of the most influential Spaghetti Westerns ever. It tells the story of Django (Franco Nero), a tragic hero with a mysterious background, who arrives at a town in war. Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) and his men try to exterminate the Mexicans, who, led by General Rodriguez (Jos\u00e9 B\u00f3dalo) are trying to set up their revolution. In between the two sides is Nathaniel (\u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez), the owner of the bar, hotel and bordello, who has to serve both sides.\r\n\t\r\nA career-launching - and defining - performance by Franco Nero is one of the elements that make this flick a success. His character is defined by a constant feel of melancholy, to which Nero brings gravitas: while never losing his cool, especially through his steely and confident stares, Django is clearly portrayed as a haunted man. The supporting cast goes a long way in cementing the heavy tone of the film, especially Loredana Nusciak, giving a gutsy performance as a prostitute who falls for the titular character.\r\n\t\r\nA notable part of this film\u2019s magic are the action sequences. While extremely brutal for their time, including a man\u2019s ear getting quite graphically severed, they are the absolute definition of \u201ccampy\u201d. Instead of ruining it, it only makes the experience more enjoyable. The violence essentially gets a more humorous vibe, serving even as a relief from all the graveness that is present everywhere else in the movie.\r\n\t\r\nThe soundtrack is remarkable: not only does it present an unforgettable theme song for the opening, but it also has a spectacular use of the leitmotif (a recurring musical phrase).\r\n\t\r\nDjango is, in every possible way, a classic and standard bearer of its genre. Even with campy violent sequences for the public\u2019s enjoyment, the film still maintains a serious storyline, and has great dramatic performances - especially by the central actor. As an answer to the question asked in the song, after gaining a huge legion of fans, it\u2019s safe to say Django will no longer be alone.",
            "Entertaining enough spaghetti western that isn't quite to the level of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly but still liked it quite a bit, including Franco Nero in the lead. Kind of blew its load early on with the machine gun massacre (would've liked the reveal of what was in the coffin at the end), but had a nice conclusion. **3.75/5**",
            "Like many films of this time/genre you have to be prepared to accept the dodgy dubbing and also, in the case of \"Django\", some particularly ropey singing by Rocky Roberts in order to give it a chance. If you do that, then you will find it moves along well with lots of shoot 'em ups - a Gattling Gun with an inexhaustible supply of bullets being pre-eminent; glamorous, but totally helpless women and an evil, brooding baddie who has virtually no lines to speak. Oh, and there is a coffin too. Franco Nero - and his legendary blue eyes - delivers his best performance in this Corbucci gem of a film."

            "**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> \u275dTreasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.\u275e\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clich\u00e9d.

            "Your Name is a film that captivates its audience from beginning to end with its superb and incredibly unique storyline. The body swap genre is one that has been explored in various films, but the way it was intertwined with a love story in Your Name is brilliant. What sets this film apart is its refusal to hold the audience's hand. The first act is dedicated to determining what exactly is going on, and this ambiguity only serves to make the movie better. The final act is incredible, with high stakes and quiet moments that help the audience process the intense emotion the characters are experiencing. There is so much to like here, and I truly think it is one of the best animated screenplays ever created.\r\n\r\nThe performances in \"Your Name\" are also noteworthy. Watching the dubbed version, I felt that everyone did a fantastic job. The chemistry between the characters was superb, and nothing was overly acted, which is a problem in some anime. The voice actors managed to convey the emotions of the characters without overdoing it, making the performances feel natural and believable.\r\n\r\nThe direction in Your Name is nothing short of amazing. There were so many unique scenes that can only be done in animation, and each one was painstakingly crafted in such a way that portrays the larger narrative. The animation itself was breathtaking, with fantastic landscapes and 3D integration. It is the best animated visuals I think I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. Its unique storyline, great performances, and stunning visuals make it a must-watch for anyone who loves animation. The film's direction is impeccable, and the attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience a heartfelt, emotional journey that they will never forget.\r\n\r\nScore: 98%\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece",

            "**Go watch as soon as it releases in your country!**\r\n\r\nI was privileged enough to be in Tokyo the day they released this movie with English subtitles and I have to say that if you enjoy \"monster\" movies there is no way you won't like this Godzilla.\r\n\r\nThe movie is set from the last days of WW2 to the early post-war. The nuclear bombs used in the Pacific gave Godzilla its super powers, and in the post war it decides to swim towards Tokyo, which of course results in a desperate attempt of stopping the monster. A former kamikaze pilot that had a previous traumatic encounter with Godzilla sees this as an opportunity to get revenge. Apart from a few dialogs and actions from the authors that are more suitable to the Japanese than the American audience, this movie has it all, romance, drama, loss, existencial crisis, and a gory and unstoppable monster. \r\n\r\nWhether you are an old Godzilla fan or a curious newcomer to this type of movie, Godzilla is one of the best movies released this year.",
            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/godzilla-minus-one-review/\r\n\r\n\"Godzilla Minus One strikes an outstanding balance between compelling character building, a thematically rich narrative, and two hours of gargantuan entertainment, ultimately becoming a noteworthy addition to the monster film subgenre.\r\n\r\nIt breaks the formulaic barriers of generic creature flicks by delivering a layered story that explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the aftermath of war. The memorable score, powerful sound design, and exquisite visuals contribute to a cinematic experience that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.\r\n\r\nWhile the lead acting occasionally falters into melodrama, it does little to diminish the overall impact of a movie that has undoubtedly earned its place among the top-tier entries in the Godzilla franchise.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "_Godzilla Minus One_ is not only one of the best films out of the 30-plus in the series, but also one of the best films of the year. The acting is superb, the destruction is immense and incredible, and the gnarly Godzilla design is fantastic. It\u2019s ridiculous, if true, that this film only has a budget of $15 million because it looks better than most Hollywood blockbusters.\r\n\r\nFull review: bit.ly/kamikaiju",
            "\"Shikishima\" (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a man with some guilt. He was a kamikaze pilot towards the end of WWII who feigned some technical problems with his plane and so landed and survived! Now, Japan is defeated and in ruins and he is feels a deep sense if shame. He manages to find a job in a wooden-hulled boat trying to collect up from the sea all the mines laid by the Allies and the Japanese alike, and it's whilst they are at sea they discover a toxic creature that has been born out of the ashes of the atom bomb. This creature is bent on destruction and nothing mankind has in it's arsenal can even dent this leviathan that possesses a deadly blue ray than can obliterate all in it's path. It heads to the land wreaking devastation and so the scientists must come up with a plan before the country is laid waste. It's really two stories. One of the man with all of his demons, his burgeoning romance with a homeless girl and her child and of his gradual realisation that maybe his life isn't quite over yet. The remainder is the standard \"Godzilla\" style special effects fest that I must admit to preferring to the more recent Hollywood versions. The style of animation here is grittier, the monster knobblier and angrier and the immediately post-war timeframe allows the photography to present us with a more attractively bleak film to look at. The ending is predictable, sure, but at least it tries to solve the problem of this marauding beastie in a little more of an innovatory fashion. Not much original here, but I still quite enjoyed it.",
            "**So good!**\r\n\r\nI have been watching Godzilla movies as long as I can remember. Most are enjoyable and enteretaining except the 1998 American made one. It's one of the worse movies I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThis movie has no right to be as good as it is! But it is good. Very good and a great movie to celebrate the 70th anniversay of the most well known kaiju in the world. Must be seen on the big screen.\r\n\r\nI didn't know a Godzilla movie could pack an emotional punch the way this film did. It's a testament to the writing and acting in this film. Kamiki Ryunosuke, Hamabe Minami, Yamada Yuki, Aoki Munetaka, Yoshioka Hidetaka, Ando Sakura and Sasaki Kuranosuke. I'm listing all the actotrs here b/c everyone played their roles well. I also, must shout out the little girl actress. I don't know her name but she was magnificent and I think she was only 3 or 4 years old. I can't give much away but the film explores survivors guilt, shame and forgiveness.",
            "This is one of the very best Godzilla movies ever made. There's a really good human story and every moment that Godzilla is on-screen is great. The post-WWII setting absolutely adds to the desperation of the main characters and the dread of having to once again survive an attacking force, this time in the form of a beast that isn't protecting the Earth or any such nonsense. Godzilla is a force of nature (or science) that doesn't care about anything or anyone.\r\n\r\nThe only drawbacks of this movie are an irritatingly manipulative moment (tugboats) and a couple of unbelievably coincidental reunions.",
            "Godzilla Minus One, is a poignant anti war film as much as it is a monster flick.\r\n\r\nI agree with other reviewers that this is by far and away the best Godzilla film I have seen, bar none. What makes it work is a genuinely moving back story of a man broken  by war, redeemed through an act of courage in the service of love, the bonds of family and ultimately life itself. \r\n\r\nActing is superb, with flawlessly honest, very human performances, from the entire cast. \r\n\r\nGodzilla effects are well done too. The destruction and the misery the monster brings to Japanese cities and their populace, is genuinely disturbing. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I loved this film more for its back story than its monster tale. Indeed, in the context of this film, Godzilla feels like a metaphor of sorts, for the real monster, which is war and the destruction it brings both physical and psychological, to innocent lives.",
            "The best Godzilla movie ever and one of the best movies of 2023? Eh, maybe.\r\n\r\nI don't have the long sordid history of watching every Godzilla movie to ever exist. My first exposure to Godzilla was Godzilla 1998. Yep, I loved watching that sleek reptilian dinosaur tear through Manhattan and to this day I am still envious of the cab driver with that 6 inch Godzilla action figure hanging from his rearview mirror. What can I say, I love dinosaurs!\r\n\r\nCompared to Godzilla 2014 and the sequels, this at least has a coherent plot with not that many stupid characters doing the stupid. It has some silly dialog and \"the plan\" is kinda dumb and requires Godzilla to lack any spatial awareness but OK, 2014 did more stupid with that nuclear warhead so, I'll give you that. We've got characters jumping to conclusions, overreacting and under-reacting, but overall this might be the best Godzilla movie ever however I feel like that a low bar considering the other Godzilla movies I've seen. Maybe with a bigger budget. Under 15M? Okay, yeah. It's the best Godzilla movie.\r\n\r\nThe monster CGI is not good. For 15M it's good. Compared to other Godzilla movies, the Hollywood Godzilla movies, it ain't good. Compared to Pacific Rim, it ain't good.\r\n\r\n7/10 from me. I quite enjoyed the very WOKE anti-authoritarianism themes. I suppose Go Woke, Go Broke don't always apply since everything I've heard about this movie is positive even though the very WOKE anti-authoritarianism is shoved in our faces multiple times, but who can really expect consistency from that lot.",
            "In the interest of full disclosure, I\u2019ve never been a fan of Japanese monster movies, and, considering how many times the Godzilla story has been told so far, I\u2019ve never been particularly interested in seeing any of them (after all, how many different variations can realistically be incorporated into the big guy\u2019s single-minded mythos?). In any event, I relented in this case, because I was admittedly curious to see the film\u2019s Oscar-winning visual effects, which, in all honesty, weren\u2019t bad (though definitely not outstanding \u2013 how this picture bested the far-superior visuals of \u201cThe Creator\u201d truly baffles me). However, capable special effects and production design considerations aside (the basis for the generous ratings I\u2019ve given to this title), this release has little else to offer that hasn\u2019t already been depicted countless times before. What\u2019s more, the film\u2019s attempts at trying to incorporate post-World War II political commentary and to be more than just a simplistic monster movie are fairly lame. Its non-devastation story threads are frequently predictable, heavy-handed, slowly paced, occasionally corny, often implausible, and, above all, boring. I frankly couldn\u2019t wait for these segments to end and get back to the supposed \u201cit\u201d factor \u2013 the monster\u2019s destructive hijinks (of which, to be perfectly honest, there were too few, given that this is supposed to be this offering\u2019s primary drawing card). Even the title of this production needs work; any picture that requires a Google search to find out what it\u2019s supposed to mean has inherent issues in my book. To its credit, writer-director Takashi Yamazaki\u2019s effort to elevate the Godzilla narrative above the B movie camp fest level genuinely seems sincere, but the end product is little more than the standard item with better visuals and a well-intentioned (but largely failed) aim at infusing the story with more substantive content. In light of the many iterations of this saga that have been filmed over the years, I think it\u2019s high time to give the persecuted sea monster a well-deserved rest for a while \u2013 a long while \u2013 and get on with the business of making movies that aren\u2019t tiresome retreads and that at last give Tokyo a chance to rebuild.",
            "**Contain Spoilers**\r\n\r\n\"Gojira -1.0\" is a visually stunning film that rightfully earned its Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The movie's impressive sound design and solid acting further elevate its entertainment value. However, it falls short in some key areas, particularly in its direction and emotional payoff.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects in \"Gojira -1.0\" are nothing short of spectacular. From the realistic physics to the terrifyingly detailed explosions caused by Gojira's atomic breath, every frame is crafted with precision. The depiction of Gojira itself is a highlight, staying true to the original bulky yet menacing design without appearing comical. This attention to detail creates a believable and immersive experience that keeps you engaged throughout.\r\n\r\nThe sound design and music, while not as groundbreaking as the visual effects, complement the movie well. They enhance the tension and atmosphere, making the scenes more impactful. The acting is another strong point, with Japanese actors delivering powerful and emotional performances that resonate deeply. Their portrayal of honor and shame, especially in the context of post-WWII Japan, adds a layer of depth to the story.\r\n\r\nThe writing of \"Gojira -1.0\" is intriguing, presenting a fresh take on the origins of Gojira with a strong emphasis on the historical context of Japan after World War II. The decision to show events through the eyes of a 'failed' kamikaze soldier is an interesting angle, though it doesn't fully deliver on its potential. The survival of the main character, while logically sound, feels anticlimactic and predictable. This resolution undercuts the emotional investment built up throughout the film, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne aspect that could have been better addressed is the radiation from Gojira. The monster emits radiation and can fire atomic blasts, yet the film doesn't explore the devastating effects this should have on the surrounding environment and people. The radiation is merely used as a plot device to track Gojira, missing an opportunity to add another layer of realism and tension to the story.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Gojira -1.0\" is a visually and technically impressive film that provides solid entertainment and remarkable detail. However, it falls short in delivering a satisfying emotional payoff and leaves some aspects underexplored. Despite these shortcomings, it remains a worthwhile watch for its exceptional visual effects and the nostalgic yet fresh portrayal of Gojira."

            "**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> \u275dTreasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.\u275e\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clich\u00e9d. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side.

            "Original title: Mononoke Hime\r\n\r\nThe film is set in the 14th Century during Japan\u2019s Muromachi Period.\r\n\r\nYoung Prince Ashitaka, the last royal of his line, slays a wild boar that is about to attack his village. The boar, demonised because it was consumed by rage and hatred, infects the young Prince, who will eventually become demonised too.\r\n\r\nHe leaves the village to find a cure in the form of Shishigami, a deer-like god. On his journey he realises that the latent rage and hatred within him, when it surfaces, gives him enormous power \u2013 proven when he slices off the arms of a Samurai warrior and decapitates another one.\r\n\r\nOn his journey, he sees a travelling group of people attacked by a wolf pack. He saves two of the men who, it turns out, are from Irontown, run by the Lady Ishobi. He brings the two men back to Irontown, which is peopled by women who do the foundry-work and chores, and men who provide the security and protection, although even that is not cut and dried as the women are capable of defending themselves with guns being manufactured especially for them by the lepers to whom the Lady Ishobi provides food and dignity. There is much humour when the women verbally chastise their menfolk. I found those scenes hilarious.\r\n\r\nWhen Ashitaka brings the men back to Irontown he is welcomed by the Lady Ishobi. He also discovers that the wolf pack was led by the wolf god Moro, and the strange girl he saw help the wolves was San, the adopted daughter of Moro. San has the ability to talk to the nature spirits, and she is therefore known as Princess Mononoke (\u201cSpirits of things\u201d).\r\n\r\nAshitaka is concerned that Ishobi is destroying the forest. It turns out that the Lady Ishobi and Moro are in battle because of the damage being done to the forest.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, Ishobi has also recruited Samurai to help her in her fight, but the Samurai have two motives: one is to take the head of the Forest Spirit back to the Emperor, who believes it will give him immortality. The second is to take Irontown from the Lady Ishobi.\r\n\r\nThat is an abstract of the plot.\r\n\r\nMiyazaki used computer-generated graphics in this for the first time, but most of the film was generated by hand. This I think is to its benefit. The drawing is breathtaking in places, and the depiction of such supernatural events as the Forest Spirit changing into the Nightwalker and the scene of the demon-possessed boar when it emerges from the forest for the first time are spectacular.\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s too scary and bloody for children, but a friend assures me that this sort of film is par for the course for children in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe film is over two hours long, and it does pack a lot into that two hours. I found this film very interesting and watchable. I wanted to know what happened, and the plot was certainly not predictable. I believed in the world it depicted. I think in any film you have to allow it to draw you into its world (up to a point, some films are ludicrous and expect too much, this isn\u2019t one of them).\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for the film\u2019s ability to keep me interested is because the characters cannot be labelled \u201cgoodies\u201d and \u201cbaddies.\u201d Yes, Moro and his pack are attacking helpless workers, but they are destroying the forest and he needs to protect his way of life. Yes, the Lady Ishobi is destroying the forest, but she\u2019s making a living for herself and is helping others: she has removed the women from servitude in brothels, given them security, work, and a home; some have found husbands or companions. She has provided shelter, home and work for the lepers, normally outcasts. Neither side seems particularly vindictive; Ishobi\u2019s attempts to rid herself of the wolf pack are for self preservation, and her coalition with the Samurai to destroy the Forest Spirit is her attempt to remove the constant threat of attack. One can argue that if she took a more conciliatory view, maybe some sort of truce could be reached, but time and again members of the wolf pack merely say \u201cthey are humans, they must be killed\u201d \u2013 to the point that even Ashitaki, who has helped the animals \u2013 is threatened with death if he does not leave the forest. In fact, one could argue that it is the animals who show a \u201cracist\u201d attitude here \u2013 demanding the death of the humans because they are humans. None of the humans in the film demand the death of the animals simply because they are animals. Their deaths, and the destruction of their habitat, are an unfortunate side-effect of the humans\u2019 industrialisation, not a deliberate act.\r\n\r\nI hope that what you see from my analysis above is that the film is not goodies v. baddies. It\u2019s nature v. industrialisation, and the compromise to that is not an easy one, and the film reflects that.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be happy to know the film does have an upbeat ending, but thankfully it\u2019s not entirely predictable, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly recommend the film.",
            "When a village is tormented by a wild boar, it falls to the young \"Ashitaka\" to sort it out. Turns out though, that it isn't an ordinary beast - and in the fight the man is afflicted with a curse that requires his journey to the great tree god to put right. His travels lead him to the unscrupulous \"Lady Eboshi\" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.",
            "This is my favorite movie from Miyazaki. The visuals are great. The characters are great. The voice acting (English version) is great. The animation is great. Music is great. The story is good. Everything about this movie is so cool and it's just really fun to watch."

            "**\"Childhood\" in a movie.** \r\n\r\nThis is just perfection - a perfect way to while away time and reconnect with your youth.  \r\nEverything is outstanding in this film, but especially the way it can emote your sense of wonder and imagination.\r\n\r\nI wish I could have watched this as a child, I would have wanted to find Totoro and the Catbus, roar like Totoro, or sleep on his belly.  Oh well...I will just have to imagine it.\r\n\r\nIts interesting to note this was released with Grave of the Fireflies, another Ghibli masterpiece, which I have summed up as being about innocence lost.  **This movie is innocence maintained.**",
            "(SPOILER ALERT)\r\n\r\nI was delighted to see this subtle/multi-layered tale unfold, which seemed to play well to both a childhood audience, keen on likable characters/compelling imagination, and adults with a deeper appreciation for the symbolic backstory.  \r\n\r\nLike most of Miyazaki's films, there was an enormous focus on the power of the natural world. Whenever man perverts the natural world, the natural world seems to pushback. It appears as though the seldom seen Mother in the story is sick due to some mental/physical disconnect that she has likely had with the natural world. \r\n\r\nThrough the unique power of children to tap into their imagination, especially children living outside the city and amongst nature, Miyazaki demonstrates the unique gift that children have to re-establish the lost bond between unhealthy adults and the healing power of the natural world. I was thoroughly impressed with how delicately Miyazaki established this bond between the two children, their imagination, and the natural world. Totoro, the lovable silent giant, is a great and unexpected metaphor for the healing power of the natural world and childhood imagination :)",
            "Aggressively cute.\r\n\r\n<em>'My Neighbor Totoro'</em> holds an extremely hearty story, one told via impeccably beautiful animation. Noriko Hidaka and Chika Sakamoto standout as Satsuki and Mei, the relationship between those two characters is so sweet. They do get a bit shouty in parts which ever so slightly irritates, but that's definitely one to file under 'nit-picking'.\r\n\r\nA simple movie, one which displays the imagination of children perfectly. Big fan of the Catbus. \ud83d\udc31",
            "cute & sweet. that's it",
            "Though maybe the story here is a bit on the thin side, this is still glorious mix of family and fantasy from the hand-drawn animation of the gifted Hayao Miyazaki. It's all about two sisters - \"Mei\" and \"Satsuki\" who travel with their father to a new, rather rustic, home. It's all a grand adventure for the girls though and they are barely through the door before realising that the house has some extra special occupants. Things is - are they benign or not! Luckily, an old lady from the house nearby sets their mind at rest and soon \"Granny\" is looking after them from time to time in between school and visits to their ailing mother in a nearby hospital. As they explore the grounds, they discover that the place is alive with creatures both natural and supernatural - and it's the eponymous beast - a sort of hybrid between a cat and a panda - that soon becomes an integral part of their adventures as they eagerly anticipate their mother coming home. It's its simplicity that really worked well for me, here. A close-knit family with some bubbling trauma provides for a setting for their situation, but it doesn't dominate the children at play. They know sadness, sure, but they also know joy and love; there's a magical eight-legged moggy-bus (or maybe that's ten legs?) and they have their shy neighbour who's terrified of the very thought of the girls! It's a delightful combination of fantasy, community and family that you're bound to enjoy. Take a brolly, though!"

            "The perspective from which we view a situation infallibly provides us with a clear, irrefutable picture of its truthfulness, right? But what happens if we encounter someone who witnesses the same incident and comes away from it with a totally different interpretation? Both views can\u2019t be \u201cright,\u201d can they? Or is it possible that none of us can see the totality of a scenario and claim to know everything about it? That\u2019s the core takeaway from director Kore-eda Hirokazu\u2019s latest feature, an ambitious, skillfully crafted tale told from multiple vantage points, all of them \u201ccorrect\u201d in their own right, despite the myriad differences that distinguish them from one another, a storytelling technique first developed by Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in the screen classic \u201cRashomon\u201d (1950). Kore-eda\u2019s cinematic homage to the famed auteur, told in three separate but interconnected segments, focuses on the exploits of a rebellious pre-teen (Soya Kurokawa) seemingly prone to acting out as a bully. The youth\u2019s unpredictable behavior, however, doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. His actions appear to be cryptically interwoven with those of his overly protective widowed mother (Sakura Ando), his young middle school teacher (Eita Nagayama), his aging, softspoken principal (Yuko Tanaka), and his effervescent best friend (Hinata Hiiragi), many of whom aren\u2019t always what they seem to be. There are forces at work here that are a cause for concern, prompting the often-asked question, \u201cWho is the monster?\u201d, a query that provides the inspiration for this film\u2019s title. It\u2019s intriguing to watch how the picture\u2019s various story threads come together, reminding us of the old adage of not judging a book by its cover, poignantly illustrating that, no matter how much we may think we know about a particular situation, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll never get a complete picture of it. Kore-eda serves up an eye-opening tale, one that gives us pause to think about our impressions and preconceptions in an age when many of us are all too quick to superficially judge what we see \u2013 and in a frequently flawed framework at that. The picture could stand to be a little more swiftly paced at times (especially in the final act), but this is arguably the director\u2019s best and most sensitive work to date, one that, we can only hope, will have the kind of profound impact we need in an age where open-mindedness and tolerance are traits we could all stand to develop to a much greater degree \u2013 particularly when pieces of the puzzle are missing.",
            "I'm not usually a fan of children leading films, but hats have to come off here for a really delightful performance from the young Hinata Hiiragi as the shy and shunned \"Hoshikawa\". We will get to him in a minute, but first the film is delivered in three parts as a fire slowly devours a city centre tower block. The first episode introduces us to \"Minato\" (Soya Kurukawa). He's a bright and friendly boy who lives with his widowed mother (Sakura Ando). She starts to notice that his behaviour is a becoming a bit erratic and after some investigation begins to suspect that he is being bullied at school. A visit to the recently bereaved Principal (Y\u00fbko Tanaka) reveals that his teacher \"Hori\" (Eita Nagayama) might be the culprit and apologies are made. The next segment takes up the same story, only this time we look from the perspective of the teacher, a caring and enthusiastic professional. Though there are similarities between the two scenarios, the conclusion from the first doesn't quite tie up with the information from the second. Then to the final instalment where the two boys take and hold really well the centre stage of this drama and we get to grips with the puzzles set already and discover more about their complex characters. It's this third phase that is quite captivating to watch. The older boy must tread a thin line between a peer pressure that thinks his friend is odd, even that he has \"a pig's brain\" whilst he, himself, realises that \"Hoshikawa\" is a friendly, curious and loyal lad who has quite a few domestic demons of his own to face, on pretty much a daily basis. Amongst the adults, there's plenty going on too. The head teacher is clearly sitting on a fairly hefty secret of her own and \"Mr. Hori\" faces a series of predicaments that reminded me a little of the recent \"Teacher's Lounge\". A typhoon, some tunnels and an old railway carriage provide a perfect focus for the concussion that isn't so much that, it's an invitation to see what might happen next. The director excels here at putting us into the minds of the children and of the adults whilst also allowing our own observations to watch a story of two young children at a sensitive stage of their lives - and it really does make you think and reminisce about your own childhood in equal measure. ",
            "This film is the highest compliment to Kurasawa's Rashoman I've ever seen. Others have tried the (perhaps bonsai rule-of-three inspired) triple-POV, but I've always just witnessed a \"yeah, so what.\" But this film - Kore-Eda's vision? Kurasawa himself would stand up and bow. It takes the master's style to a completely new level.\r\n\r\nYuji Sakamoto and Kore-Eda have created the perfect film here. It's tight, it's paced incredibly well, and it's complex and layered like a fine wine. Kore-Eda threw away the book of film directing, and created two hours of in-your-face, up front and personal story-telling. And surprisingly, it worked quite well here.\r\n\r\nAnd Ryuichi Sakamoto's score? Is this where we talk about life after death? It's a masterful fit for Kore-Eda's vision."

            "Perfect Blue perfectly blends psychologically disturbed fantasy with grounded reality. Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima\u2019s abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.\r\n\r\nThe late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as \u201canime\u201d, is cited as \u201cchildish\u201d. \u201cAnime is for losers\u201d tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai\u2019s narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.\r\n\r\nThe complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female\u2019s world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.\r\n\r\nKon\u2019s intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series \u2018Double Bind\u2019 essentially replicating Mima\u2019s regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima\u2019s mental instability. He doesn\u2019t stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It\u2019s not just a psychological thriller. It\u2019s horror.\r\n\r\nKon\u2019s signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of \u201cMe-Mania\u201d, only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi\u2019s audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon\u2019s trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words \u201cperfection\u201d, it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released.",
            "I caught this in High School and it instantly took me as an eerie Alfred Hitchcock show that did an outstanding job of feeding on pure paranoia.\r\n\r\nIt was unsettling, it was scary, and at the time it seemed as realistic as it could be for an anime movie.\r\n\r\nAs I rode through it, I started doubting what was real and what wasn't and that is a hallmark of a great movie, that ability to keep the viewer on their toes.",

Her manager insists he can get her an acting job on a popular soap - and that's the way to fame and fortune. Like so many other impressionable young folks, she tries to follow her dream - but is really only following his, and is soon being photographed (intimately), denigrated and her grasp on reality is soon compromised. When things start to take an altogether more sinister turn, though, we start to wonder just who is responsible for a series of murders amongst those known to hold disparaging views on the young woman. Might she be developing some form of lethal schizophrenia or is she (and are they) really the victims of an over-zealous fan. At times this is actually quite harrowing. The plundering of her innocence by those both venal and neglectful of this young woman is writ large and is really quite depressing to watch. The story itself deals frankly with the unsavoury nature of not just exploitation, but of the pressures the constant search for success can put on a developing mind. This packs quite a lot to think about in in eighty minutes, and 25 years on is still a potent watch.",

Its exploration of unsettling themes such as consent and exploitation may make for uncomfortable viewing, but it's a stark reminder of the issues we still face. Despite some parts feeling dated, its prediction of the Internet as a tool for stalking and the rise of social media for harassment is particularly noteworthy."

            "Liberal snooty types lashing out at conservative cronies and their right-wing leanings should have made for some enjoyably edgy satire, but 'The Hunt' is merely a by-the-numbers comedy-horror-suspense thriller that has a few punchy moments. But, if production company Blumhouse wants to remake a bunch of 90s Jean-Claude Van Damme action movies with Betty Gilpin in the lead role, I think I'd be down with that. I'd watch them, not in the theatres obviously, but late at night after a few beers.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-hunt-blunt-lazy-and-undeserving-of-controversy",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know, I'm from Portugal. Why does this matter? Well, The Hunt was delayed after a massive shooting in the USA, and since the movies' themes are extremely sensitive, the producers decided to postpone the film. At the time, I felt frustrated that, once again, movies have to suffer from real-life situations. Going to the theater is supposed to be an \"out of this world\" experience. The audience is transported into a fictional place where real-world problems can be forgotten for a couple of hours. So, I never handled these constant controversies surrounding films very well...\r\n\r\nWith that said, I believe The Hunt not only benefited from that delay, but its satirical story has even more impact now. There's no way around this. Craig Zobel's movie is meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years. I know it's a pretty basic analogy, but it's just like a dark humor standup show. If you don't have any issues with jokes about topics like racism, stereotypes, immigration, refugees, religion, politics, and every sensitive theme that your mind can imagine, then you'll find The Hunt a brilliant allegory of society's most extreme people. If you do have problems with this type of comedy, then stay away from this movie because Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out!\r\n\r\nWhen I write that every remotely sensitive taboo subject or activity is unrestrainedly addressed, I mean EVERY SINGLE theme. This is a narrative completely packed with extreme, over-the-top cliches and stereotypes of both right and left political sides. At first glance, The Hunters feel like the \"bad guys\", in the sense that they're hunting innocent people for pure pleasure. Once the audience understands the reasons behind the selection of the people being hunted, one small but tremendously effective thought enters everyone's mind: \"you know what... the world would actually be a better place without this kind of people\".\r\n\r\nSuddenly, not a single character is worth caring about. To clarify, I don't mean \"caring about\" in the common, emotional way. No character is written with the purpose of making the audience worry about it. In fact, almost every character (maybe except Betty Gilpin's) is a despicable human being. Their view of the world is clouded by ideologically outdated mentalities. I love how the screenwriters use each character to represent a particular type of ... extreme personality, let's call it that. One of the best compliments I can give the film is that it didn't pick a side. Everyone gets blasted with jokes.\r\n\r\nIt's a dark yet hilarious satire of today's society with a special focus on the close-minded people that go online to try and spread their conspiracy theories and immoral beliefs. Everything that I just wrote so far resembles the movie's impact on the viewer: either you're okay with this type of screenplay and you'll be incredibly entertained; or you'll get extremely triggered by all this. It's one of those films that will end up on a bunch of \"Worst Movies of 2020\" lists simply due to its narrative's nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story isn't the only aspect that can make people give up on watching this movie. The actual hunt is as over-the-top as everything else. There's blood everywhere, ridiculously disgusting deaths, and absolutely no limits whatsoever in killing people in the most insanely entertaining way possible. Action-wise, The Hunt is better filmed than a lot of blockbusters. Beautiful wide shots when something (or someone) explodes, exceptional (and hilariously long) choreography for the \"final fight\", and excellent editing overall. It's genuinely a well-made, well-produced, and well-filmed movie. The score is also pretty cool.\r\n\r\nObviously, it's one of those films that's easy to pinpoint flaws. Every single paragraph that I wrote above can be interpreted as some of the worst aspects of the entire movie, depending on each person's perspective. In my opinion, I think the ending would have benefited from a more serious tone, but at the same time, it would probably clash with the widespread satirical one, so it's an inevitably difficult ending to completely get right. The cast is a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to each actor's performance (some are very bland), but Betty Gilpin delivers an outstanding display and seamlessly carries the whole film. Finally, there's a small part of the movie that involves military characters who don't belong to either side of The Hunt, and that portion didn't really work for me.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Hunt is a brilliantly dark satire on today's political views of the world. It's meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years, and it undoubtedly succeeds in its mission. Just like dark humor, either you're okay with it, or you're not. If you can't take a joke about the most extremely sensitive taboo themes (and I mean ALL of them), then stay away from this movie or you'll be triggered for a whole week. However, if you can see the fun side of this type of comedy, The Hunt is the most entertaining, witty, hilarious, bloody, over-the-top action thriller you'll see for a long time. Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out, and they don't forget to approach a single topic. It's a well-made film all-around: well-written, well-produced, and well-filmed. A few minor issues regarding its ending and a small subplot don't diminish Craig Zobel's exceptionally captivating concept and Betty Gilpin's compelling performance. I definitely recommend it depending on how much you enjoy dark humor.\r\n\r\nPS: everyone knows the tale about the rabbit and the turtle, right? How the rabbit races the turtle, and all that? Well, The Hunt's version of that story just became my all-time favorite.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "> Review From **_Horror Focus_**\r\n\r\nGaining its momentum back in mid 2019, The Hunt stirred up quite a bit of controversy prior to its initial release, branding it too brutal for release due to the mass shootings in Ohio, Texas last summer. This Blumhouse picture was later rescheduled, and was at one point never to see the light of day, which would have been a crushing blow knowing how relevant this actually turned out to be. Luckily for us, Blumhouse soon caught on and realised movies like The Hunt are exactly what our cruel audience\u2019s need right now, something with a sharp satirical bite with a gut-punching narrative reflective of modern society. Welcome to my favourite horror movie of the past few years.\r\n\r\nImagine a Twitter thread was made into a movie, this is The Hunt. What we have here is a film that functions on the confliction that exists in the real-world between liberals and conservatives, as they take chunks out of each other when discussing politics online, spilling blood on each side as opinions and views are torn to shit by the opposing party. What is depicted is literal death and carnage, which is representative of how the different identities and political views that are one person's beliefs, but another\u2019s infuriating joke.\r\nImage result for the hunt 2020 film\r\nThe beauty here (which is addressed as a massive concern to most reviewers) is the lack of depth to these characters within The Hunt, and to their lifestyle choices and political standpoints. What works best is that it never takes a stance when mocking both sides of the political spectrum, and allows us as an audience to identify which whatever our political views lead us to, even if one side is draped in murderous overtones. I admire how we are left to decide where we would stand, and if what is happening is something we can sympathise with. To most, what I\u2019m saying sounds ridiculous, but this lack of depth to these characters is very much reflective on the current state of our social media, having people who we know nothing about spreading their views which are toxic to half and relatable to others.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s that online fa\u00e7ade that is at play here, as we witness comments and statements daily that tear down others, ruin people\u2019s professional statuses or simply to spread offensive and insensitive comments online to troll others. This is the world we live in, and the characters in The Hunt exist within our real world. The characters within this may not be fleshed out, but to the online profiles with nothing but a name, a picture and a flurry of controversial tweets neither are they, and that certainly looks like modern day humanity to me.\r\n\r\nMuch of The Hunt\u2019s satirical sting comes from its reliance on our current climate and political correctness, which leans on its accurate depiction of society to get its laughs in when it can. It\u2019s understandable that this particular sense of humour might to a little too one-note for some, but it firmly has its own tongue planted in its cheek when openly mocking our current way of thinking, juxtaposing these characters with opposing mind-sets to create a genuinely clever and on-the-nose depiction on humanity\u2019s contemporary views. Aside from the intelligent links to modern society, it\u2019s also really enjoyable and highly entertaining when utilised to its full potential. One could be offended by some of the humour here, but when the film itself jokes on our own generation of snowflakes, it begs the question if The Hunt is pointing the finger at you, and calling you out for being said snowflake. It all really works for me on a sharply pungent level, one that had me tickled pink until the final credits. The Hunt ultimately holds up a darkly comedic mirror up to the political divisions in a way that hasn\u2019t been explored to this stature.\r\nImage result for the hunt 2020\r\nThe action here is outstanding, with the violence being the appropriate level of over the top to match its exuberant premise. Betty Giplin is undeniably outstanding as she delivers a powerhouse of a performance in her portrayal of Crystal, a tough as nails heroine who easily establishes herself in the ranks next to such genre greats as Erin from You\u2019re Next and Alien\u2019s Ripley. Her level of badass is contagiously ferocious, making every scene she\u2019s in an absolute blast to witness. Each fight scene is crafted brilliantly, looking seamlessly effortless with its high-energy intensity, most notably when we reach our final act in which our Million Dollar Baby Hillary Swank comes head-to-head with Giplin, which can only be described as one of the most entertaining fight scenes in recent horror memory.\r\n\r\nNothing is ever fully dripping in suspense, but you soon realise it doesn\u2019t need to be when you\u2019re watching enigmatic fight scenes that are as vicious as they are diverting. The film also works its best when it plays at its most unexpected, knocking familiar faces off like Drew Barrymore in Scream level of unexpected in ways so gleefully gory it will have you laughing with sheer shock. The Hunt may split audiences right down the middle, but there is one thing that is universal, and that\u2019s that Betty Giplin\u2019s Crystal is already this decades best Final Girl.\r\n\r\nVERDICT \r\nProving to be one of the strongest contemporary social and political horror movies in recent memory, The Hunt is a lean, mean, fighting machine that is as sharply satirical as it is viciously violent. Make room for Betty Giplin, our new final girl is in town.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",
            "Irony of ironies that this movie's release got pulled due to Trump's shitfit despite never having seen it, when a not insubstantial part of _The Hunt_ is about the left's propensity for sparking outrage without having the whole story. The reality is, the nothing _The Hunt_ has to say is worth being outraged over. Betty Gilpin's great in it, because of course she is, intermittently there some pretty fun violence, and only **most** of the dialogue is incredibly awkward, but if you want any sort of consumable message, or witty repartee, don't be fooled by people on any end of any spectrum, saying that's something you can find here. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",
            "It was... fine. Nothing really to write home about, but some decent kills and gore, plus true subverting expectations with the cast of characters killed off early on. Kind of peters out towards the end but overall it's worth a rental but one could wait until it's available for free as part of a streaming service. **3.5/5**",
            "I knew this film was going to be something different but I didn\u2019t read anything about the film before I started watching it. And this is my absolute recommendation to anybody who is thinking of watching this film. Don\u2019t read anything about it. Just watch it. It is different, obscure, unusual, political, weird and overall awesome!\r\n\r\nWould I watch it again? Yes! Would I make my friends watch it? Absolutely!",
            "Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best, if weirdly refreshing movies I've seen in quite some time.  I'm a sucker for a good survival movie, and this is an \"elites hunt people for sport\" trope mixed with a good mystery plot if there ever was one.  The story structure alone is worth the watch as it essentially runs 3 (-4) sequential stories to tell one overall story while telling you about the story structure.  Some movies clearly put a lot of effort into keeping you on your toes, this movie just does it.\r\n\r\nNot only is the gunfighting immaculate, but the combat action sequences are amazing.  Betty Gilpin steals the show every time she's on screen, and I would normally say she's the one that carries the movie, but the movie is good enough that even though she's over the top great, I can't say the movie needs her to carry it.\r\n\r\nThere is an investigative aspect of the movie that is very intriguing, but that is given in the \"why are they doing this to us\" of it all, but unless the villains give an \"evil speech\", then it should be expected.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy human vs human survival situations, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this one.",
            "**_Satirical look at Left and Right in a \u201cMost Dangerous Game\u201d setting_**\r\n\r\nSeveral non-Liberal people wake up in the middle of nowhere, possibly Arkansas, to discover they\u2019re being hunted by cutthroat Leftwing radicals. \r\n\r\n\"The Hunt\" (2020) takes the basic-Zaroff scenario of \"Open Season\" (1974) and \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and applies it to the Left\u2019s ire toward \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Unlike those other two flicks, this is an amusing satire that pokes fun at both political sides while arguably veering toward pro-Conservative, at least more so than pro-Left.\r\n\r\nBetty Gilpin is quite effective as the protagonist, Crystal, while Hilary Swank eventually shows up in the last act for a knock-down-drag-out climax.\r\n\r\nThe film is snappy at 1 hours, 30 minutes, and was shot in Louisiana, including New Orleans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",
            "Basically, there are a ton of 1 star reviews on IMDb complaining that it makes the left look bad... despite, you know, things like Antifa and their belief that a red hat means they gt to physically assault people.\r\n\r\nSo I am going to give it 10 stars... because my wife had a milk shake thrown at her for being a \"race traitor\" and, on our way back from work we got egged (along with everyone else at a red light) in an attempt to convince us to support impeachment.\r\n\r\nAnd, because of that I think that this works as a satire about that attitude that having a different opinion means they have the right to act violently, by taking that attitude to an extreme.\r\n\r\nAnd when reviewers write sentences like \"insipid portrayals of both the elite and the deplorables\" it only serves to reinforce the attitude that the film is parodying, that attitude that they are \"elite\" elevated above all others, and those in the out group are dehumanized as \"deplorable.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the vast majority of the 1 star reviews are written with a vocabulary that so perfectly echoes the people that the film is a satire of that it is almost impossible not to see the brilliance here.\r\n\r\n\"Elite\" and \"deplorable\" a part of me thinks that they realize that they are the subject of satire in this film... but can't seem to avoid acting exactly like the people that are being mocked here.\r\n\r\nSo, congratulations, language of the negative reviews alone make this a brilliant satire."

            "What makes \u2018Parasite\u2019 so satisfying is that it commits neither error. It\u2019s an engrossing, stylish and near perfect movie, and its underlying themes go beyond merely pointing out class exploitation to challenge the logic of capital. Though he is often juggling a mosaic of characters, themes and social issues, Bong never eschews his anarchic impulses and dark humour. It\u2019s a movie that should be seen as widely as possible, if only so that Bong Joon-ho gets more chances to make movies for modern audiences that badly need them.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-parasite-a-bloodthirsty-and-very-funny-look-at-class-warfare\r\n\r\nHead to https://www.maketheswitch.com.au/sff for more Sydney Film Festival reviews.",
            "The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo\u2019s, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an \"in\" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn\u2019t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don\u2019t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience\u2019s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do say it\u2019s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we\u2019ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren\u2019t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It\u2019s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don\u2019t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don\u2019t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn\u2019t essential to it.\r\n\r\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don\u2019t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I\u2019ve seen in 2019. Highly recommended!",
            "This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED. \r\nThe most part of the movie is foul-playing, most of those scenes seem to have been copied from the 1999/old Vijay\u2019s movie: Minsaara Kannan [IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7562630/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2], (Warning: This again might be a copy of some other movie as well]. \r\n\u201cMorse code\u201d has been used in a much better way in 2017 Ajith\u2019s film: Vivegam [IMDB:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6878378/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0] [Letterboxd: https://letterboxd.com/film/vivegam/]\r\nI just don\u2019t understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly. It is not even 10% of the Tamil movies at this level/standard.\r\nPeople who\u2019re praising this movie must start watching Tamil movies instead of Korean, there are so many gems that have gone unnoticed.\r\nThere is really nothing special in this movie that stands out. \r\nCannot digest that an average movie like this has got so much limelight. Btw: Where does this kinda BS trend start off?",
            "errbnb\r\n\r\nNews that Adam McCay is collaborating with Bong Joon Ho to retool Parasite as a Netflix series makes me positively giddy. Parasite is easily the best movie I've seen since the Big Short. Joon Ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. I would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. The story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. The Bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. The poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. The hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic Shakespearean bloodbath. It's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (Note to the rich: Check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). Decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make Parasite a must-see for all income brackets. You don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. But please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks. Never combine the rich and poor without safety goggles or outside the confines of a controlled and supervised laboratory setting.",
            "\"You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.\"\r\n\r\n'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.\r\n\r\nI admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.\r\n\r\nThe movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.\r\n\r\nThe performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year.",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nYes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm \"following the pack\". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!\r\n\r\nIt can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.\r\n\r\nThere's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought \"this is too much, this would never occur\". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I \"should\" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...\r\n\r\nRating: A+",
            "Decent enough dark comedy/thriller, with nice performances and an engaging story, though not entirely sure it was Best Picture worthy though reserving judgment as I've only seen one other nominee, Joker which I loved but not worthy of a BP.\r\n\r\nI don't know, maybe I'm a bit disappointed given the awards the film won and my viewpoint would've been different seeing it a couple weeks back.

            "**_An uncategorisable masterpiece_**\r\n\r\n>_We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service \u2013 two dishes, but to one table._\r\n\r\n- William Shakespeare; _The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke_, 4.iii.23-24 (1599-1601)\r\n\r\nWhat is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define _Gisaengchung_ [_Parasite_]? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, after Billy Wilder's _The Lost Weekend_ (1945) and Delbert Mann's _Marty_ (1955), _Parasite_ is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon-ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night \u2013 four (Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay). On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is _Parasite_? Described on its official website as a \"_pitch-black modern fairy-tale_\", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature \u2013 part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the _Ulysses_ of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like _Ulysses_, it's exceptional in just about every way \u2013 screenplay (co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, _mise en sc\u00e8ne_, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things \u2013 it lives up to the hype.\r\n\r\nThe Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. And so, hiding the fact that they're all related, Ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, Chung-Sook as a housekeeper, and Ki-jeong as an art therapist for Da-song. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.\r\n\r\nWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth. At the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Parasite_, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to \"_Hell Joseon_\" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of Koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. \r\n\r\nObviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth \u2013 the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes in _Sarinui Chueok_ [_Memories of Murder_] (2003), _Gwoemul_ [_The Host_] (2006), and _Madeo_ [_Mother_] (2009). _Parasite_'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with Bong's English-language work, _Snowpiercer_ (2013) and _Okja_ (2015). Never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, _Parasite_ feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.\r\n\r\nIn the film's press notes, Bong states;\r\n\r\n>_I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. It's not just in Korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross. The only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other's breath. In this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. In today's capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. We keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed._\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the Kims and the Parks aren't simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies.\r\n\r\nOne of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clich\u00e9s one so often finds in films dealing with economics \u2013 the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families \u2013 obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp, we first meet them as they're wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour's WiFi signal. Later, as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. \r\n\r\nThere are no heroes and villains here \u2013 Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot; Da-hye and Da-song rarely leave their rooms, Yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and Dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect \u2013 this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he's doing.\r\n\r\nIt's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. Strictly speaking, the Korean title, \"_\uae30\uc0dd\ucda9_\" (\"gisaengchung\"), means \"helminth\" rather than \"parasite\", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn't a big deal. In any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well \u2013 they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. Concerning this issue, in his Director's Statement, Bong says,\r\n\r\n>_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? It's not that they were parasites from the start. They are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice._\r\n\r\nHowever, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot Lee Chang-dong's superb _Beoning_ (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.\r\n\r\nIt's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the \"upstairs/downstairs\" subgenre (think James Ivory's _The Remains of the Day_ or Robert Altman's _Gosford Park_), Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways \u2013 one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance.\r\n\r\n_Parasite_ is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie \u2013 a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich \u2013 but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art; it's the best Palme d'Or winner since Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ in 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costner's _Dances with Wolves_ in 1990. Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series English-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, Parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it's received.",
            "First of all it's a masterpiece, it's shows how the higher class actually judge the lower class people. At it looks like a normal story of a family who all are struggling hard to live, but their life gets changed when all four of them one by one get employed in park's house. After sometime we also got to see the frustration and anger of Kim family on park family because they were judged by them.their were no unnecessarily plot twist in the film which led the film very smoothly. All over it's a must watch film.",
            "\"We all live in the same country... called capitalism.\" \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._",
            "What starts as a seemingly simple premise quickly unfolds into much more. I didn't expect an enhanced perspective into my own life, but that's just what happened. Parasite is a timely analysis of the ever-increasing divide between rich and poor, all while being witty enough to make for an exhilarating ride.",
            "One of the funniest and most disturbing films I've ever seen. Probably some of the best cinematography ever. 10/10",
            "Despite hearing about this from day dot, I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than it's title, director and subsequent success. Boy am I glad, because it's quite the ride!\r\n\r\nNo doubt about it, <em>'Parasite'</em> is a high quality film. It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.\r\n\r\nThe cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun.\r\n\r\nI don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film. From the cinematography, to the dialogue, to the locations, to the humour. You name it, this produces it on an impressive level.\r\n\r\nNot that I need to say this, given I'm seemingly one of the last few who hadn't, but you must watch this!",
            "<i>Parasite</i> is fantastic. \r\n\r\nIt's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act. \r\n\r\nIt fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene.",
            "Loved it! It's a different kind of movie from your usual run of the mill kind. The twists and turns in the storyline keep you engaged. Recommended!"

This is comedy level shit, even if the rest of the movie was good, this would have destroyed it.",
            "Peninsula came amidst extremely high expectations for being the sequel of one of the best zombie movies ever. This movie is completely unrelated to its prequel, _Train to Busan_, so you can watch it even if haven't seen the first one. The plot follows another group who fled from Korea in a refugee boat to Hong Kong. Fast-forward 4 years, the surviving members of the group return to a deserted Korea to ransack the abandoned money. A task that should be easy, but Incheon is not as deserted as they thought it would be.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of action scenes and good visual effects, Peninsula failed in the casting of the support roles. The main actors are pretty good, but the acting of the foreigner (that is, non-Korean) characters is laughable. Also, parts of the plot and some actions scenes are highly implausible, to say the least.\r\n\r\nHowever, Peninsula is still a very good movie, ranking high in the \"Best Zombie Movies\" list. It didn't live up to the expectations from _Train to Busan_, but perhaps the bar set by the prequel was just too high.",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nTrain to Busan is one of my favorite South Korean films ever, and I firmly defend that it's one of the best zombie apocalypse movies of all-time, maybe even the best. Therefore, I couldn't help but feel incredibly excited about another installment set in the same world. It's not a direct sequel to the original's story, but it seems to be placed just after the pandemic began. Unfortunately, it ends up being a huge disappointment.\r\n\r\nDespite the jaw-dropping stunt work and the extremely intense action sequences, the reason why Peninsula's predecessor works so well is due to its focus on the characters. By giving them a compelling development and a strong emotional bond, the zombie outbreak becomes instantly more effective because of our immense concern for everyone involved. Every technical element is dialed up to its maximum, transforming the film into an emotionally devastating, heart-wrenching story.\r\n\r\nYeon Sang-ho tries to follow a shortcut to achieve that same emotion of his previous movie, dooming this \"sequel\" from the very beginning. Every relationship feels forced, and the supposedly heartbreaking decisions/events are a complete target miss. Even the action scenes fail to live up to the original's level due to excessive CGI in ridiculous car chases. Every fifteen minutes, a major logical issue arises, and some characters are either straight-up dumb or unbelievably smart for their age/experience. Peninsula takes the realistic environment established by Train to Busan and fictionalizes it way too much.\r\n\r\nRating: C-",

To carry out all these searches, Google's data centre uses 0.01% of worldwide electricity._\r\n\r\n- \"122 Amazing Social Media Statistics and Facts\" (Kit Smith); _BrandWatch_ (January 2, 2019)\r\n\r\n_Searching_ is a film with two main organisational principles; there's the thriller plot, which ostensibly keeps everything moving, and to which everything else should, in theory, be in service. Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which. If we're being really honest, in fact, the plot becomes more and more incidental as the narrative progresses and ever more ludicrous flights of fancy are introduced, transposing the story from a search for a missing girl into a litany of clich\u00e9s and melodrama. On the other hand, the main reason, indeed probably the only reason any of us saw the film at all is because of its unique visual schema, and thankfully, this aspect is realised with an impressive degree of craft. You know you're in reasonably secure territory when the filmmakers are self-aware enough to begin an online film depicting the latest in consumer technology with the sound of an old dial-up connection.\r\n\r\nWritten by Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, and directed by Chaganty, the film begins with a montage of video clips depicting various events in the recent lives of David Kim (John Cho), his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn), and their daughter Margot (Michelle La). The montage covers several years, taking in Margot's childhood, Pamela's diagnosis with cancer, the disease going into remission, her relapse, and, finally, her deterioration and eventual death. This brings us up to roughly the present day, with Margot now a teenager who has drifted apart from her father, although David himself doesn't seem to have noticed. In the early hours of the morning on a night when Margot left the house to attend a study group, she calls David three times, but he is asleep and doesn't hear the phone. Seeing the missed calls the next morning, and realising Margot isn't in the house, he tries to call her back, but her phone is turned off. Assuming she left early to attend a piano lesson, he calls the teacher, but she tells him Margot cancelled the lessons six months prior. Thereafter, he discovers that the money he had been giving her for her lessons was instead being deposited into her bank account, and, several weeks ago, the entirety was transferred to a now deactivated Venmo account. Frantic, David reports her missing, with the case assigned to Det. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). However, as David and Vick begin to delve deeper into Margot's life, David is shocked to learn she has no friends at school, and has instead an online existence of which he knew nothing. Meanwhile, every investigative avenue seems to throw up another mystery, and as time passes, it begins to look more and more as if Margot has simply run away. David, however, refuses to believe this, with his wildly vacillating suspicions regarding who may have been behind her disappearance ranging from a friendly YouCast (video blogging site) user, a disrespectful pot-smoking Facebook user, his own brother Peter (Joseph Lee), and everyone in between.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plot has a reasonably strong forward momentum, with a well-judged pace, it comes across as initially insipid, and ultimately rather ridiculous. If this was a standardly shot film, without the unique visual design, no one would be giving it a second glance \u2013 the thriller plot is clich\u00e9d, derivative, and trite, and despite the foolishness into which it descends, it's also fairly predictable (I guessed who the villain was, although not why they were so villainous). In this sense, the film reminds me of something like Robert Montgomery's _Lady in the Lake_ (1946) or Sebastian Schipper's _Victoria_ (2015). Both feature dull and hackneyed plots that serve only as something onto which to hang the structure, rather than the other way around; _Lady in the Lake_ is shot entirely in the first-person, whilst _Victoria_ is shot in a single continuous take, and neither is worth looking at for their plot, characters, or dialogue.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the aesthetic aspect of _Searching_ is much more successful, with almost the entire film taking place on a computer screen, with Facetime conversations, iPhone messages, security camera footage, and TV material rounding out the design. It's a fascinating hook, and thankfully, it does more than simply exist to carry a poorly written plot \u2013 the filmmakers actually have something to say, albeit nothing too revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to know is that the aesthetic is extremely well crafted; from Chaganty's direction to Juan Sebastian Baron's cinematography, to, especially, Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's editing; logistically, this can't have been an easy film to plan or shoot, and the fact that the various components that go into making up the final image all work so well together suggests a great degree of care. In tandem with this, whilst the overarching plot is poor, Chaganty and Ohanian's writing is excellent in terms of how it continually finds natural ways to confine the action to a screen \u2013 whether it's David looking into Margot's finances, Vick watching FaceTime conversations, TV news showing security footage \u2013 never once did it feel like a gimmick, like it was being forced to stay within the computer screen simply to satisfy an abstract aesthetic rubric. It all worked reasonably organically, and after a few minutes of acclimating yourself, you barely even register it anymore.\r\n\r\nWithin this, the filmmakers are even able to throw up a few surprises. For example, the structure grants us more access to David's interiority than would be possible in a regular film. How so? Simple \u2013 by employing something we've all done, many times. On several occasions, David is shown typing something during a conversation, only to delete it, and send something completely different, whether because the first message was angry, or emotionally revealing, or accusatory etc. Anyone who has spent any amount of time talking online or via text will be familiar with this, and the use of it in the film allows us a glance into his psyche, showing us where his mind is in an unfiltered sense, before self-censorship kicks in. It only happens a few times (if it happened too much, it would become meaningless), but it really does impart a degree of psychological verisimilitude that I wasn't expecting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as mentioned earlier, the film actually uses the visual design to offer some social commentary, which is, again, something I wasn't expecting. Chaganty himself is a former Google Creative Lab employee, so he would know a thing or two about issues such as the uses and over-uses of technology, the unpleasant side of online culture, and the notion of digital footprints, and it is these areas where most of the film's more salient points are concentrated. For example, the addiction to technology and social media so prevalent in today's culture is right there in the set-up \u2013 the entire Kim family are obsessed with speaking to one another via phones and computers, and recording pretty much everything, often at the expense of having more natural face-to-face conversations. Another subject is the toxicity of the internet, the prevalence of online troll culture, and the tendency for people to say things online that they never would in person, believing that the anonymity afforded by the internet gives them the right to be unpleasant. This is communicated primarily through one scene \u2013 after watching a news report about Margot on YouTube, David begins reading the comments, which almost immediately start making jokes about him having killed her, and being \"father of the year\" (presented as a meme, obviously, because typing is such a drag).\r\n\r\nA very pertinent topic in the wake of Trump's election is the dissemination of fake news, and this is conveyed through a half-funny, half-unpleasant scene \u2013 shortly after realising Margot is missing, David speaks to Abigail (Briana McLean), at whose house the study group had taken place, who confesses that she barely knew Margot. Later on, however, when the media is swarming all over the case, she is seen on the news, tearfully lamenting how much she misses her \"best friend.\" The impossibility of ever being invisible online is another topic. Yes, the film is about a person who had an entire online existence that no one knew about, but that was only because no one had looked. Once someone did, and once a few threads were pulled, everything is exposed, as the impossibility of erasing ones digital footprint becomes manifest in the story. Anyone who has spent any amount of time online will be familiar with many of these issues, and the fact that they all ring so true, without the film becoming preachy, is a testament to the quality of the filmmaking.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this cannot be overemphasised, the film includes a pitch-perfect, perfectly timed, perfectly delivered Justin Bieber joke that is absolutely hilarious, and has to be seen to be appreciated.",
            "Searching blew me away even though I saw it after Run, Aneesh Chaganty's later feature, and having heard and read everything about how similar Mahesh Narayan's c u soon is. The intensity of the plot, its unpredictability, and the conviction of the characters are what stood out for me in this unconventional thriller that is also so relatable and real. Watch it right now if you haven't. **8 stars**.",
            "Searching is a mystery thriller film shot from the perspective of our main characters computer screen. In most movies of this nature, this is done as gimmick and does not feel natural in the story telling. But here, the technology is seamlessly integrated into the story where the two are inseparable. John Cho does an excellent job of being the lead here. His emotional connection with his daughter is a driving force of the plot and the turmoil he goes through in discovering that the connection he has with his daughter was all on the surface is superb. The unknowns surround our leads daughter creates so much tension and mystery as we are trying learn about the character along side the father. The editing is top notch here as the story maintains a very coherent progression while balancing multiple windows and views of the computer screen. There were plenty of twists in the story, some worked well and others fell flat for me. The movie does a little bit too much at the end, but overall was great.\r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great",
            "*Searching* is one of those movies that grabs your attention from the very start with its unique storytelling style. The entire film unfolds through digital screens, which adds an intriguing layer to the narrative and feels surprisingly natural. The story builds a solid foundation, with good pacing and character development that makes you genuinely invested in what\u2019s happening. John Cho delivers a strong and emotional performance as a father searching for his daughter, and the way the movie balances suspense with heartfelt moments is impressive.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of *Searching* is how it incorporates technology into the story without feeling forced. It\u2019s refreshing to see a film that uses tools we interact with every day\u2014like social media and video calls\u2014in a way that feels realistic, even if some details are slightly dramatized. The film does a great job of keeping you on edge, and the twists keep coming at just the right moments to keep things interesting. However, the last act felt a bit underdeveloped, with some pieces of the puzzle not landing as effectively as the rest of the movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, *Searching* is a well-executed thriller that deserves credit for trying something different and pulling it off. While it isn\u2019t perfect, especially toward the end, the innovative approach and strong performances make it worth a watch. If you enjoy a good mystery with a fresh presentation, this one\u2019s definitely worth your time."

Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.\r\n\r\nMaybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine. From one of the film poster, I thought it was Michael Sheen. Only realised while watching the film that it was Guy Pearce. From writing to the making, it was a very good film. But the story could make some people uneasy. Because everything that's happened between the people and their relationship, not for soft guys. Yet it is a must see thriller, a must see western.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",
            "A congregation dressed in black, hymns being sung flatly, an evil preacher, an abortion scene in the first 15 minutes... \r\nI should have known from the title that it wasn't the good western that the cover image conveyed. I could not make it through 20 minutes before I had to shut it off.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie which seems determined to slander the most beautiful message that exists - the message of Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nIt is also another point of evidence that rated \"R\" and \"MA\" movies simply means \"movies not worth poisoning your brain with\".\r\n\r\nThe actors were great. They played the roles well. But the subject material, the script, and the very idea of it is not worth consuming.\r\n\r\n**Psalm 10:4-6**\r\n\r\n**4** The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God:\r\nGod is not in all his thoughts.\r\n\r\n**5** His ways are always grievous; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight:\r\nAs for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.\r\n\r\n**6** He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved:\r\nFor I shall never be in adversity.",

            "**A good Western, despite its weaknesses.**\r\n\r\nMany decades ago, Italian Western films were a huge success and guaranteed the careers of several actors, such as Clint Eastwood, and directors like Sergio Leone. This film, however, is neither Italian nor American: despite being spoken in English and featuring North American actors, it is a film directed by the Dutch (Martin Koolhoven and his team), shot in Spain and where Hungarians and Austrians also collaborated. Out of this Babel of nationalities, however, emerged a good Western film.\r\n\r\nThe plot is the strongest point of this film, which wonderfully works the epic style and a tension that grows, chapter by chapter (was I the only one to see in this chapter organization and non-linear narrative some influence by Tarantino?). I won't reveal too much about the plot, but I think I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment if I say that everything revolves around a young woman who tries to escape from a crazed Protestant pastor who is determined to kill her, no matter the place or the circumstances. The film builds an absolutely detestable and maniacal villain, and gives the female character the gifts and strength to defeat him, and to captivate us with sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe film is not perfect, there are logic flaws, continuity flaws and absurd situations. But the film nevertheless entertains the audience very well. Guy Pearce stands out the most, giving life to a captivating and execrable villain. The actor is excellent and gives us the best work of his career so far. Dakota Fanning holds the central female character and handles the task at hand well, but I felt several times that she doesn't have a challenging task. Kit Harrington can complain even more, since he saw his character killed early and didn't have time to show talent, despite the film being almost two and a half hours long.\r\n\r\nRegarding the length, I am of the opinion that it would have been better with about thirty minutes less, and that this denotes a certain sloppiness in the editing and in the selection of the scenes that should have been in the final cut. The film is impactful, it is quite violent, realistic and not suitable for teenagers, impressionable people and animal lovers (as far as I know, no one was hurt in the filming, but there are several intense scenes that include animals). The sets and costumes were very well-designed, despite the fact that the film works in a certain temporal limbo in which it is very difficult to have a sense of the time in which everything happens (somewhere between 1880 and 1910?). The scenarios are also very good, and the soundtrack was very well conceived.",
            "Yeah, another Western, had to wait for the wife to not be home so I could dive into a genre she hates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's odd how sex and nudity seem out of place in westerns given that in real life prostitution thrived. Historically a lot of what this film is about could be true. But... it doesn't feel like it should be in a Western. Racism and violence, yeah, those can make it in and feel right. Prostitution, certainly... but in a not seen sort of way.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know, it's a lot of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart with Clint Eastwood bringing up the rear that sort of defines the genre for people my age.\r\n\r\nThat being said... it's dark.\r\n\r\nBut it's done right, and it's well acted, and it plays on the emotions something fierce, it's well acted, it's moody. In other words it's an insanely well done movie, despite that fact that it deals with subject matter that you don't expect coming into a western.\r\n\r\nInsanely well done."

Approach in incredibly tense interactions through the lingering camera, minimal editing (Peter Sciberras), and contemplative music (Jonny Greenwood). The aimless first half might only be a first-watch issue, but nothing that profoundly hurts the overall piece.\r\n\r\nAn awards contender that I definitely recommend watching, even more than once.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "Jane Campion's direction is top-notch, beautifully shot by Ari Wegner, and Johnny Greenwood's score fits like a soft leather glove. But that script - oh so Hollywood and oh so boring!! I want my 127 minutes back.",
            "**Full Explanation and Analysis at Spotamovie.com - The Story** - The Power of the Dog, a book written by Thomas Savage in 1967, inspires the film. It\u2019s not your typical western. No guns are involved, but something more complex and psychological. Located in Montana in 1925, two wealthy and different brothers, George and Phil, own a ranch.Their lives change when they meet Rose, a widow, mum to Peter, a delicate but intelligent guy. Different personalities and interests generate a hostile environment for all of our characters. After the chaos, the dreamed balance may rise again, but, first, the story will become intense, engaging and exhausting.What will happen between them? Why George and Phil are different? And what is The Power of the Dog? It\u2019s a complex film, full of symbolism, metaphors and psychology. It\u2019s well-directed, excellently performed by the whole cast. And it\u2019s not a case that, as we mentioned above, Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst are in nominations as best actors at the Golden Globe 2022. - **Analysis **here https://www.spotamovie.com/the-power-of-the-dog-explanation-and-review-2021-movie/",
            "The ending does not match the pacing of the the entire film at all. It's almost abrupt - and not in a terribly satisfying way. It could have been 30 minutes shorter if it did less artful shots of wheat or a horse standing. Or at least for less time. It doesn't even really say anything interesting about it either.",
            "Brothers \"Phil\" (Benedict Cumberbatch) and \"George\" (Jesse Plemons) are the bit chalk-and-cheese brothers who own a successful cattle ranch. On a trip to town, \"Phil\" upsets the owner of the hotel \"Rose\" (an effective Kirstin Dunst) after he rather cruelly insults her extremely svelte teenage son \"Peter\" (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who had taken some care to prepare intricate paper decorations for their dining table. We don't know how long \"George\" and \"Rose\" have been friends, but next thing we know they are married and the pretty unpleasant \"Phil\" sets out to make her life as miserable as possible. He is never overtly cruel - there is no violence, but mental abuse that sends her seeking solace in the bottle. When her son joins them from school, he fixes him fairly and squarely in his sights too - introducing a hint of homo-eroticism and scheming to the last fifteen minutes that makes you sit up. Again, no action as such - there are no gunfights or fisticuffs, just a cleverly structured denouement that I felt fitting. The pace is really slow, the dialogue pretty laconic, Cumberbatch's accent is all over the place and the score becomes wearisome after a while - the sounds of the constant high pitched violins really did begin to grate. It is a lovely film to look at, plenty of attention to the detail, but it is altogether just a bit so what.",

They\u2019re wealthy ranchers who are polar opposites. Where Phil is brutal and ruthless, George is kind and quiet. Their relationship splinters when George marries Rose, a widow (Kirsten Dunst). Campion makes you believe that this is where the meat of the movie will be, in this fractured brotherly relationship, and for a while it is. It\u2019s a fascinating look at two versions of masculinity at odds with each other in a world that could be considered the peak of masculinity. I couldn\u2019t help but think of Kelly Reichardt\u2019s First Cow and Andrew Haigh\u2019s Lean on Pete, two lovely movies grappling with the same concept of masculinity in the harshness of the American West."

            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI consider Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz (Greta) one of the best actresses of her generation. I would be pretty surprised if she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination in the next ten years. While it's true that her choices don't always end up being good movies, she's rarely the one to blame when things don't work out. In Roseanne Liang's film, she's undoubtedly the glue that holds everything together. Moretz perfectly handles what it's close to being a solo movie - she's literally stuck inside a tiny turret - demonstrating extraordinary emotional range.\r\n\r\nFor most of the runtime, the viewers are placed inside a claustrophobic place, watching the protagonist communicate through radio with the other crew members, who so happen to be extremely sexist, annoying male characters. While I do understand the intent behind this character archetype, it becomes so on the nose that it almost makes the director and her co-writer, Max Landis, the ones who seemingly never met any other type of army men. The narrative holds so many distinct ideas that go from a monster flick to a war drama, and their balance is all over the place, just like the score (Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper).\r\n\r\nOnce the mystery surrounding her package is revealed, and the action sequences start taking the front stage, the story takes a huge leap into the utterly absurd. From one of the most shockingly hilarious uses of an airplane explosion to the unbelievability of everything that happens in the third act, it isn't easy to shut down my brain when the film until that point was going more for the grounded depiction of how it is to be an isolated woman in the Air Force than a straight-up sci-fi/monster/action flick.\r\n\r\nDespite all that, I can't deny its entertainment value and the exceptional lead performance.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
            "Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is a really great thing to go into a movie with extremely low expectations, and I certainly went into this thinking it's going to be boring.  That's its a WW2 courier movie, but it really is so much more.\r\n\r\nIt honestly feels like this is a collection of stories that are all stitched together in a fantastic way.  It's modular storytelling, and while it's a trend I've been noticing in the beginning of the 2020's this goes above and beyond.  It's almost a 5-act movie, but each act is it's own 3-chapter act.  They nailed the writing in this so that it is both powerful and captivating.\r\n\r\nIt's not just a WW2 story (though that's the setting), it's not just a woman's story, it's not just a hero vs evil story, it's not just a captive / isolation story, it's not just a combat story: it's really all of these and more with some great cinematography to enhance it all the way though.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely worth the watch, and don't let any aspect of \"I heard it was an x movie\" stop you.\r\n\r\nThere is something for everyone here, and it's all good.",
            "This might be one of the most entertaining things I\u2019ve ever seen. Simply stupendously sensational stuff.\r\n\r\n<em>'Shadow in the Cloud'</em> is bonkers, I had a blast watching it. There were no rejected ideas in the writers room, that\u2019s for certain! I'm glad to see that this hasn't been slaughtered via reviews; at least not to the level I was expecting. It\u2019s utter madness and I\u2019m fully here for it, the amount of craziness they fit into less than 80 or so minutes is nuts; the special effects - aside from the iffy end fight, granted - is neat for a production of this standing.\r\n\r\nChlo\u00eb Grace Moretz legit gives a great performance, easily her best that I\u2019ve currently seen. The rest of the cast fit their roles well, with the radio comms made great use of for large portions for the cast behind Moretz. I thought it\u2019d get boring being so talky at the beginning, but it never did.\r\n\r\nImmense rewatchability to this, I\u2019ll no doubt be revisiting it. It makes absolutely zero sense, like whatsoever, but it might be the best 'switch off your brain' flick out there. No joke. It's unashamedly stupid and I kinda love it; you definitely can't deny its originality either!",

She has a secret cargo - but what could it be...? As they travel, some of the rather asinine crew become suspicious of her, her package and when they begin to see things; when things start to go a bit awry with the plane - then the crew must brace themselves for quite a surprise! Sadly, though - the execution of this isn't up to much. The acting is poor, the special effects straight from an episode of \"Stargate\" and the score tries very hard to compensate for the lack of menace generated by either cast or director. The story allows itself to get caught up in the relationship issues of the crew, never a great thing with an adventure film and the ending is just plain daft. Sorry - I love my sci-fi, but this is just really disappointing."

            "<em>'Captain America: Brave New World'</em> came close to pleasing me, but in the end I think it is not consistently enjoyable enough to be classed as something I'd want to watch again and/or recommend. There is quite a bit about it that I did like, but the down moments hurt the ups.\r\n\r\nThe cast and their characters are positives. I'm a big fan of Anthony Mackie's as he has done many roles in films that I've highly, highly enjoyed; interestingly, he has appeared in three of the fourteen films I've given a total 10/10 to. Here, he is very good in the titular part.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone overly attached to Marvel and therefore Chris Evans' Captain America, so this new era doesn't hinder my interest in the lead character. I'm admittedly not wholly convinced Mackie is undoubtedly a perfect fit for the role, though his performance itself is perfectly watchable and fun enough.\r\n\r\nCarl Lumbly's performance as Isaiah is great in this, he genuinely made me care quite a bit about Bradley; especially in the more emotive scenes. Danny Ramirez, Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito (a little typecast still, sadly) and Tim Blake Nelson (albeit the weakest) are also pluses that I have for this movie.\r\n\r\nMy main issues lie with the plot and how it is told. There were too many moments where I could feel myself losing interest in events onscreen, most notably across the first half. The second half is better paced, if still not making for superb viewing. I was firmly awaiting the credits, which is never a good sign.\r\n\r\nWhen I was locked on to the story, I did dig it. I particularly found the interactions/dynamics between characters to be solid, for example Cap with Carl, Joaquin and Seth. I just think what lets this down, unfortunately to a somewhat damaging degree, is that the plot just isn't quite good enough. A shorter run time (even though it isn't that long) may have helped, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nI just realised that this is the first MCU film that I've scored below 7/10. That feels harsh, it isn't as bad as that sounds at all, but thinking about this and the other flicks from the franchise that I've rated similarly it is actually merited. <em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> and <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em> were my bottom two, both are better films.",
            "\u201cBrave New World\u201d but same old yarn, sadly. Morgan Freeman clearly didn\u2019t fancy this one so Marvel have resurrected another ex-president in Harrison Ford to put together a treaty that will deliver the old save the globe type of thing. It\u2019s all about this giant hand-shaped structure that has emerged from the ocean and that contains \u201cadamantium\u201d - and that\u2019s even more indestructible than \u201cVibranium\u201d (how can something be more indestructible?). Anyway, before this accord can get signed off by a curious quadrumvirate of the USA, India, France and China a shipment of this new material gets pinched and it\u2019s down to \u201cCapt. America\u201d (Anthony Mackie) and his new sidekick \u201cTorres/Falcon\u201d (Danny Ramirez) to retrieve it. Loads of end-to-end fisticuffs later and the goods are secure which earns our dynamic duo and their inspirational trainer \u201cBradley\u201d (Carl Lumbly) an invitation to the White House. That\u2019s where the wheels really do come off as their pal starts taking potshots at the President and we discover that the erstwhile somewhat militaristic and temperamental \u201cRoss\u201d and \u201cCap\u201d aren\u2019t exactly on the same page. It\u2019s pretty obvious that there\u2019s a third party pulling the strings so it\u2019s going to need all of his patience and guile if the shielded wonder is to retrieve his mentor from solitary, rebuild his relationship with his president before that man really sees red, and also get to the bottom of a dastardly scheme that seems bent on causing international strife between the USA and Japan. Mackie\u2019s a charismatic man and he does what he can with this, but the story comes across as little more than an hybrid of \u201cTop Gun\u201d (1986) meets \u201cTomorrow Never Dies\u201d (1997) with an unremarkable cast, including Ford\u2019s \u201cRoss\u201d, that struggles to make any impact as it races along for two hours without presenting anything original or particularly entertaining. It passes the time, but is yet another bland offering from a studio that is increasingly resorting to it\u2019s creative technicians to design something that looks great but resonates not remotely. Disappointing, sorry.",

Most importantly, Anthony Mackie's performance as Sam Wilson proves, without a doubt, that he was the right choice to wield the shield left behind by Steve Rogers. The actor perfectly captures the duality of being both a global symbol and a man still searching for his own path, bringing a unique approach to the legacy of the titular hero.\r\n\r\nIt may not be top-tier MCU, but it's a film worthy of being experienced on the big screen.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

            "While I find it the same general quality of a majority of what Marvel has put out, it is a flawed film with moments you could tell were caused from one of the many reshoots they did of the film. (It was shot 4 times) One funny example is when Cap and Falcon are on the run they \"ditch their smart phones\" so they can't be tracked. Leaving them in their offices. On the Car ride to their destination, Falcon isn't wearing a watch. Then at the destination he's wearing a Smart Watch. You know something that can be tracked..... Anyway it was off putting to have Hulk's cast and Villains but not included him, at all. Not even a photo, just \"old news footage\" from the Harlem battle. Mr Blue doesn't even mention Bruce at all. Instead blaming everything on Ross.\r\n\r\nWhat the film did have, I'm sure it makes much more since if you watched Falcon&Winter Solider, but if you didn't they sort of explain things in the film. At least the short 1 dialogue explain it way. The ending battle was a, what the heck? Move and what happened to the President make little Legal since, although in one cut of the film he died. Because Bruce nor She Hulk are in prison, so at best they would keep him locked up until he learned to control it. As the illegal thing he did was, what the Accords already did, keeping a dangerous super locked up. Not very well, but still the same thing. Definitely not as bad as some say it is, but not joining the few MCU films I will rewatch or rewatch over and over again. I give it a C-",

            "## Story: 9\r\n\r\n**A gorge shrouded in mystery**\r\n\r\nAt first it appears as a typical adventure or action story but as the film progress, it is slowly revealed to be about a place shrouded in mystery. The flow kept the audience guessing but only to find out it's totally something unexpected.\r\n\r\n## Visuals: 9\r\n\r\n**It gave me the feels of Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft**\r\n\r\nIt was awesome. I kept wondering where the location was, if it even exists. The special effects and design, most especially at the critical part of the story, were beautifully done. As a gamer, it gave me a sense of the places from Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft.\r\n\r\n## Sound: 8\r\n\r\n**It was immersive**\r\n\r\nThe sound effects were great and perfectly timed. It helped in building the mystery and suspense. It was immersive.\r\n\r\n## Character: 8\r\n\r\n**Done perfectly**\r\n\r\nThe main characters were fit for the story. Ordinary people, or snipers, who only wanted to survive and serve their country. People with special skills but at the end of the day, are no different than everyone else. The character backgrounds were not lacking nor it took too much time, and the rest of the character development brought out the basic need of human beings.\r\n\r\n## Enjoyment: 10\r\n\r\n**Kept me on my seat**\r\n\r\nI truly enjoyed watching this movie. Being able to bring me into the story, ensuring I don't spend time analyzing the plot, was an experience I rarely have these days. This movie was did that and kept me on my seat.",
            "The woman is hot. It's a cool setup. Kind of but...why do the automatic guns not work the first attack and why are the mines set to explode the fence (defence) as well as the Ents? Seems just kind of dumb.  Are these the first two to bridge the gap? None of the romance matters. They are both just horny and no build up before he goes over there. \r\n\r\nThis movie is long, boring and pointless. Wait, Corporations are evil. All they care about is money. They don't value human life. They don't value the environment and LOOK AT THE HORRORS WE HAVE CREATED!!!!!",
            "The Gorge (2025) is a movie that gets a lot of things right, blending action, romance, and a bit of suspense into a well-paced story. The plot is simple yet clever, unfolding naturally without unnecessary complexity. It keeps things engaging with steady character development, making you feel connected to the leads as their situation evolves. While some critics seem to take the romance out of context, it actually makes perfect sense within the story. It\u2019s not just there for the sake of it but develops realistically based on their circumstances. Sure, there are some plot holes, but unless you're watching just to nitpick, they don\u2019t take away from the experience.\r\n\r\nVisually, the movie stands out with dramatic lighting and smart camera work that keeps you immersed. Even daytime scenes carry a certain mood that adds to the film\u2019s atmosphere. The cinematography is well thought out, with the right angles capturing the emotional depth of the characters while also making the action sequences hit hard. Speaking of action, while there\u2019s plenty of it, the movie does lean more into its emotional core rather than being a full-on action spectacle. The CGI is solid, blending in naturally without feeling overdone, and while some moments might remind you of other films, it never feels like a cheap copy.\r\n\r\nThe performances are strong, with both leads carrying the entire movie effortlessly. Their chemistry feels real, and their dialogue doesn\u2019t come off as forced or unnatural. The script is well executed, moving the story forward at the right pace without dragging things out. The music and sound design complement the film nicely, enhancing key moments without overpowering them. Overall, The Gorge has a high rewatch factor, the kind of movie you'd want to show a friend just to experience it again. If Apple gives it a sequel, there's a lot of potential to expand on what made this one work so well.",
            "The Gorge (2025), directed by Scott Derrickson, is a unique mix of action, horror, and romance. Starring Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy, the film follows two elite snipers assigned to guard a mysterious chasm hiding dark secrets.\r\n\r\nWhile the film delivers thrilling action and strong performances, some critics feel the romance subplot falls flat. The pacing is uneven, with a slow setup and a rushed climax. However, the genre-blending and chemistry between the leads make it an entertaining watch.\r\n\r\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3.5/5)",
            "The Gorge works, in spite of some conspicuous short comings.\r\n\r\nLets get the negatives out of the way. An absurdly illogical story, filled with characters who do improbable, often stupid things. A lack of clear direction in terms of what the story is supposed to be, a love story, an action thriller, a horror, fantasy, sci fi tale?\r\n\r\nOddly, I would argue its the creative cocktail of discordant genres and elements, that actually helps this film succeed. Firstly, \"The Gorge\" works wonderfully as a romance. The chemistry between the key characters sparkles with humour, quirkiness and passion. It functions too, as a fantasy horror, sci fi, thriller with highly creative story and action aspects, that come together beautifully. CGI is only okay but it functions well enough, to make things creepily exciting. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I enjoyed this film. Its compelling, exciting, likeable and inherently watchable, in spite of its often glaring shortcomings. My advice, take a look and see if you agree."

            "<em>'Flight Risk'</em> is a film that I'm not totally convinced by, though in the end I think I like it. On the one hand, it has inconsistent suspense, has dodgy humour and doesn't truly entertain like an action thriller ought to. On the other hand, the performances are good, the exterior plane shots are convincing and the twisty nature makes it watchable.\r\n\r\nMark Wahlberg (amusing accent), Michelle Dockery and Topher Grace are actors that I enjoyed watching here, Grace manages to overcome some cringey dialogue that was (hopefully, for his sake) written for him; the banter isn't great, the more serious stuff he is solid at. Monib Abhat also has iffy comedy, though does make it work more; a mostly voice role helps.\r\n\r\nOverall, a fine time at the movies. Like last week, I was fortunately able to watch it as part of a double header on the big screen - this time with Steven Soderbergh's <em>'Presence'</em>. Back-to-back 90 minutes, I'm cool with long run times but sometimes its nice to have films of such a length. For what it's worth, that other flick is the better.",
            "With the boss of the \"Moretti\" crime family about to go on trial, his accountant \"Winston\" (Topher Grace) thought it better to skedaddle to the Alaskan wilderness. Unluckily for him, determined deputy marshal \"Madolyn\" (Michelle Dockery) tracks him down and engages the pilot of a single-prop aircraft to fly him back to New York to turn state's evidence. The pilot (Mark Wahlberg) is one of those annoyingly chirpy guys and off they set. It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but after she notices a few scars on this man, it proves to be a great deal bumpier as their tiny little cockpit becomes the scene for quite a power struggle. It's that claustrophobic environment and quite an engaging effort from Wahlberg that deliver here as this airborne game of cat and mouse hots up. Sure, it does repeat itself once too often and the story is really all quite predictably weak, but the scenario does work well enough and with Grace's wise-cracking and a competent performance from Dockery it's actually not a bad watch for ninety minutes.",
            "Mark Wahlberg crashes a CIA helicopter into an aeroplane then beats up some Koreans.  Masterpiece.",
            "Flight Risk (2025) starts off promising, with a strong setup, solid camera work, and an intriguing atmosphere. The first few shots in the cabin pull you in, and the takeoff sequence gives some nice scenic visuals. But once the plane gets in the air, the movie loses its edge. The direction is competent but lacks any real flair, shifting into a standard back-and-forth between characters that makes everything feel predictable. The plot tries to build tension with espionage and intrigue, but it never fully develops. There are a lot of questionable decisions made by the characters, and the script doesn\u2019t do much to make them feel believable.\r\n\r\nMark Wahlberg delivers a solid performance, holding his character well, but the supporting cast doesn\u2019t bring much to the table. The CGI is a weak point, especially considering how much the movie relies on it. With most of the story taking place inside the plane, you'd expect at least the exterior shots to be convincing, but they aren't. The action sequences feel choppy, and some moments defy logic in ways that take you out of the experience. The score is there, but nothing stands out. Overall, Flight Risk had potential but ends up being an average thriller that leans too much on familiar tropes without adding anything new.",
            "Flight Risk crashes and burns in spectacular fashion. It's so confused about its own identity that it never takes off. It awkwardly straddles the line between brainless action flick and tense, claustrophobic thriller, failing miserably at both. The overall writing is a disaster, with dialogue so wooden that even the most mundane conversations feel like an endurance test. The pacing is just as dreadful, with lifeless, generic interactions dragging between absurd fight sequences. In addition to the unthinkable level of suspension of disbelief, the cast is also unable to improve the appalling material.\r\n\r\nTopher Grace delivers an awful performance, while Michelle Dockery and Mark Wahlberg - who admittedly commits to his lunatic role - can't escape the movie's overwhelming ridiculousness. Wahlberg's bald head and absurd dialogue make it impossible to take him seriously. But the real disappointment is Mel Gibson, whose direction is incomprehensibly dull. For the man behind Braveheart and Hacksaw Ridge, this is an embarrassingly uninspired effort. Adding insult to injury, the film's noticeable green screen and atrocious VFX make everything look cheap and artificial.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst films of the last few years."

            "I know this film has attracted a lot of criticism but I personally don't think \"Kraven, The Hunter\" is a bad film.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this is a fresh, down to earth, departure from your standard Marvel Franchise films.Idiots in over bright Lycra or Spandex  outfits, are, thankfully, absent. \r\n\r\nInstead, you get a more conventional, satisfyingly  believable, character. One who happens to be have been given special powers, that feel primal and earthy, compared, for example, to hammers and lighting bolts.\r\n\r\nActions reasonable too, with settings I could relate to and a story that's well told, if unsurprisingly, somewhat formulaic.\r\n\r\nIn summary, one of the better Marvel universe franchise films. One I actually largely enjoyed watching, in spite of my initial reservations. Worth a look.",
            "Kraven was what I would call a good holiday action film that probably didn't get a good chance.  I have no idea why it seems every Marvel associated movie is getting the fan negativity treatment.  Not every movie will be a triple A Endgame film.  Kraven was a secondary character at best in the comics so I think you have to set your expectations appropriately.  I hope that the movie does well on streaming and physical sales.  I would have liked to see how the story arc would have gone in future films but unfortunately it probably won't get a sequel.\r\n\r\nMy advice to anyone watching movies these days is go see it yourself and don't believe the charged reviews.\r\n\r\nI thought the story was good, the acting was fine and the special effects were done well and more grounded and gritty than your normal super hero movies.  Kraven was another antihero type in this film and I think that worked well for his introduction.\r\n\r\nAnother point is like many comic book movies, this wasn't necessarily true to the comics but I enjoyed the character and story nonetheless."

            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/gladiator-ii-review-a-legacy-sequel-that-triumphs-through-spectacle-and-emotion/\r\n\r\n\"Gladiator II may not achieve the groundbreaking impact of the original film, but it remains an impressive cinematic experience, transporting audiences into an epic filled with emotional and visual grandeur.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott once again showcases his mastery in blending narrative, action, and thematic depth, delivering a sequel marked by superb technical execution and standout performances, particularly from Denzel Washington. Despite the inevitable comparisons to the classic, the iconic filmmaker presents a story that justifies its existence, even if it treads familiar ground.\r\n\r\nNecessary or not, what truly matters is the strength (and honor) with which a work captivates us - and here, Gladiator II triumphs.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "Another trash Woke movie from Hollywood. There were never black (African) emperors in Roman empire... This movie is simply false propaganda.",
            "_Gladiator II_, a polished echo of the original, is a testament to Ridley Scott's cinematic powers. It follows his hit-and-miss _Napoleon_ biopic last year, which was rather miss than hit. The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.\r\n\r\nPaul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen. His mission to lure Gen Z away from their streaming devices may help to save cinema, ushering in a new era of appreciation for the big screen. But for the love of Jupiter, I hope they quickly learn that it isn't just a big iPad with comfy chairs. No pausing, swiping, mid-film selfies, dashes to the bar, or running commentary required. Screen four at your local cinema isn't the Colosseum but a place where the magic of film of this scale truly comes alive, offering a unique and immersive experience that can't be replicated at home.",
            "<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!\r\n\r\nI only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.\r\n\r\nOh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.",
            "Sixteen years after \"Maximus\" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins \"Geta\" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother \"Caracalla\" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general \"Acacias\" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It's this latter man who leads an attack on the home \"Nanno\" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife \"Arishat\" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn't go so well and next thing, she's gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he's now a slave owned by the manipulative \"Macrinus\" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin \"Lucilla\" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to \"Spartacus\" and it's the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It's episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator \"Gracchus\" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn's imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn't really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don't deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott's \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn't work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better. It really does need a big screen to appreciate the creatively crafted visuals, but I was still pretty disappointed, sorry.",
            "Comparisons will be inevitable and Gladiator II will never be as iconic as the 2000 classic. However it is very good, strong all-around with gripping action and a well executed script. Performances are very good, with some pleasant surprises.",
            "Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny\u2019s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).\r\n\r\nWhile those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.\r\n\r\nPedro Pascal doesn\u2019t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn\u2019t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal\u2019s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.\r\n\r\nHanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn\u2019t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno\u2019s fate in his lap halfway through, which he\u2019s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.\r\n\r\nConnie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.\r\n\r\nCalling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington\u2019s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.",
            "pssst.... it's woke, but that's no surprise.\r\n\r\nWhat is a surprise is that people are giving spoiler alerts.  I don't understand why.  Like so many movie squeals and reboots what you have here is Gladiator with everything intelligent and entertaining sucked out of it.  So it's the same movie, but shorter.  There are two emperors rather than ones.  Rome is falling, but not from the debauchery, intellectual laziness, and over stretched militarism that really caused it's fall... that would be anti-woke to point out it collapsed for all the reasons they love.  Instead some lazy leftism the right is evil crap, peppered with fiery but mostly peaceful protests blamed on the thinly veiled reference to Trump.  Might as well have the baddies wear red hats that read \"Make Rome Great Again.\"\r\n\r\nWith lectures.  And I don't need to go over the political lectures, they are all the same.  Woke Hollywood is predictable and best described as \"The Who to Hate Network.\"\r\n\r\nThe worst part is Denzel, I mean I know he still needs to work, but come on man, you're better than this.",
            "Are you not entertained? Well, quite frankly, no....  \r\n\r\nGladiator II or Gladiator lite as I like to call it is the \"essentials\" brand version of Gladiator. You know like, the \"essentials brand\" of underpants as opposed to known brands like Bendon or Jockey. They do the job, they're okay but still the brand names are just \"better\".\r\n\r\nGladiator lite (II) mimics its predecessor but its predominantly just a bare essentials remake of a superior, original film. The story is a rather basic \"almost\" version of the year 2000 film starring Russell Crowe, the protagonists more or less fill the same or similar roles and well, that's about it. Oh but for a dash of difference, they do have CGI sharks, monkey's and rhino's, if, for whatever weird reason, that's your thing.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this is really just a rather uninspiring \"almost\" facsimile, of a vastly superior, original film.  Its not bad as such, its just feels like a  beige re-run of sorts, that need not have been made.",
            "After many years, the sequel of the movie is really great, go to the cinema and watch it.",
            "Denzel is a badass. I love Denzel. He does the tongue thing from Joaquin's role in the first. Not even he could save this pile of crap.\r\n\r\nThe CGI somehow is worse than the original. Historical battles are cool but not even historical battles could save this pile of crap.\r\n\r\nThe Mandalorian is cool. Not even the Mandalorian could save this pile of crap.\r\n\r\nIt's a pile of crap.",
            "When Ridley Scott decided to revisit Gladiator, it sounded like an opportunity to expand on one of the greatest historical epics. Instead, we got a rehash that feels more like a missed opportunity than a bold sequel.\r\n\r\nThe first act rushes through familiar territory. A general, born out of combat, loses his family and ends up as a slave. Sound familiar? It\u2019s the same setup as Maximus\u2019s story, minus the emotional weight. And sending Lucilla\u2019s son away to protect him? That\u2019s not just a weak plot point, it spits on everything Maximus and Marcus died for.\r\n\r\nThe second act brings nothing new to the table. The \u201ctwist\u201d is predictable, the plot messy, and the villains uninspired. Commodus worked because he was layered, a mix of insecurity and cruelty. Here, the two emperors are generic placeholders. Even the attempted coup feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, with none of the intensity or buildup that made the first movie iconic.\r\n\r\nThe third act delivers a visually stunning battle but lacks substance. The final showdown offers nothing fresh, and the death of the antagonist in front of everyone feels like it\u2019s trying to copy the original. The speech about \u201cMaximus and Marcus\u2019s dream\u201d? We\u2019ve heard it before, and it meant more the first time.\r\n\r\nWhat was the point of that last scene? There were so many ways to end this movie with a high note, something meaningful to honor Lucilla or Acacius. Instead, we get a hollow, pointless ending that adds nothing to the story.\r\n\r\nCredit where it\u2019s due: the cinematography, CGI, and score are outstanding. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece, with breathtaking scenery and polished editing. The music, while clearly inspired by the original, carries the mood well. But great visuals can\u2019t save a story that refuses to move forward.\r\n\r\nGladiator 2 had potential, but it\u2019s stuck trying to recreate past glory instead of delivering something new. It\u2019s visually impressive but ultimately hollow.",
            "$250 million, and the best we get is\u2026 rabid monkeys? Ridley Scott\u2019s Gladiator 2 feels like a parody of itself. Pascal\u2019s character is utterly unnecessary, a cardboard figure who exists solely to fill runtime without contributing anything memorable or meaningful. D.W., despite his undeniable talent, is saddled with a bafflingly underwritten role, spouting clunky dialogue as the story collapses around him.\r\n\r\nAs for the central narrative about Maximus Meridius\u2019 son? Trivial and painfully predictable. The \"legacy revenge\" arc is telegraphed so clearly you could write the script after the first act. No twists, no depth\u2014just a paint-by-numbers retread of the original\u2019s emotional beats.\r\n\r\nGlory to Dondus indeed."

There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series.

It had bad dialogue for some scenes, and a weird sub plot about shoes.\r\n\r\nOh, and also, one of Eddie's flashbacks he wasn't even there for.",
            "Perhaps this was just one sequel too many as the story here is really rather thin, but there's still enough chemistry between \"Eddie\" (Tom Hardy) and his eponymous symbion to raise a smile or two. This time it's not just the pursuing human population that's a problem for them, but there are creatures from the homeworld of \"Venom\" homing in on their unique \"codex\" so that they can help free their leader from incarceration to wreak havoc on the universe. Along the way, they encounter the hippie \"Martin\" (Rhys Ifans) and his family and cadge a lift in their VW camper-van whilst offering a fairly tuneless rendition of some David Bowie. It all builds up to a fairly predictable denouement with humanity facing some tough choices, the seemingly indestructible aliens on the verge of success and our intrepid partnership having to consider the ultimate sacrifice. Yep, we've seen it all before and though the visual effects are pretty impressive, that's not really enough to sustain it as it rather procedurally rolls along. There is occasionally some wit in the script and Hardy looks like he's having fun, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is largely under-used and it relies far too heavily on repetitive combat scenes to really make it stand out amidst the surfeit of 2024 comic-book derivatives. It's all watchable enough, but it's not a patch on the first one from 2018.",

I find them over stated, not especially intelligent and oftentimes, quite repetitive. \r\n\r\n\"Venom\" is the rare exception to this rule. For starters there's Tom Hardy, who is, by any measure, an excellent actor. Secondly, there's the interplay between Hardy and Venom which can be genuinely funny. \r\n\r\nThis latest and possibly last film in the series, \"Venom: The Last Dance\", is, I believe, the weakest in the line up. Unlike its predecessors, it feels a little bit rushed and somehow, anti climatic. That said, it still has its moments of engaging humour and not half decent action.\r\n\r\nIn summary, its a shame to see \"Venom\" shelved (if in fact that's the case) as its one of the better Marvel universe franchises, with great chemistry between Hardy and his other worldly alter ego, Venom. Worth a look if you enjoyed the other films.",

            "<em>'Love Hurts'</em> is one I highly enjoyed, thanks to thoroughly entertaining action, a good cast and a nicely paced 83 minute run time. There are things that can be classed as issues, for example the internal monologues are iffy and it's perhaps a tad over sentimental in parts.\r\n\r\nThose aforementioned things aren't a big deal for me though, like at all. I'd recommend this and would happily revisit it, I'd imagine the rewatchability is pretty high. The pure action is great to watch, there is some top stunt work on show. It's super satisfying to see unfold.\r\n\r\nKe Huy Quan brings a strong lead performance, as he is supported competently by Ariana DeBose - who has been extremely busy this last year or two, not that that's a negative as I do enjoy seeing her. Daniel Wu, Marshawn Lynch, Andr\u00e9 Eriksen and Sean Astin are decent too.\r\n\r\nMustafa Shakir is the best behind Quan/DeBose, probably the best character overall in terms of the look, body language etc. Also, is it just me (most likely) or does he look/sound like he'd be a perfect Scar from <em>'The Lion King'</em> - I can't unsee it. If Disney ever go <em>'Cats'</em>-esque *shudder*, he's their man.\r\n\r\nIt makes little sense and is too silly in certain moments, granted. However, I had the desired amount of fun with it.",
            "Sadly, Love Hurts is Ke Huy Quan\u2019s first film as a leading man after winning an Academy Award for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Quan\u2019s acting career was sparse for nearly 40 years, but trained in martial arts his entire life and worked with Corey Yuen (martial arts choreographer for The Man with the Iron Fists, director of The Transporter) as a fight coordinator on X-Men and a stunt choreographer on Jet Li\u2019s The One.\r\n\r\nQuan is the highlight of Love Hurts. He\u2019s likable and conflicted as Marvin Gable. Quan has this relatable charisma to his performances and that\u2019s no different here. He\u2019s wise and compassionate in the film while willing to tutor whoever is willing to listen. His action sequences are impressive with the speed and innovation of a Jackie Chan fight and a kind of brutality you\u2019d find in a modernized Shaw Brothers film.\r\n\r\nOther decent aspects of the film are Marvin\u2019s brother Alvin (Daniel Wu), better known as Knuckles, drinking boba tea whenever he\u2019s on screen. You half expect him to bleed boba by the end of the film. There\u2019s also a knife-wielding hitman (think Danny Trejo\u2019s Navajas in Desperado) called Raven (Mustafa Shakir). Raven has the best fights in the film, but he writes poems whenever he isn\u2019t killing.\r\n\r\nWhile the action is mostly solid in Love Hurts, the first actual fight in the film is rough. Involving bumbling hitmen Otis (Andre Eriksen) and King (Marshawn Lynch), who bicker like an old married couple and argue over Otis\u2019 wife wanting to leave him like a weird bromance you\u2019d find in a goofy stoner comedy like Pineapple Express, you can noticeably see Ke Huy Quan\u2019s stunt double in this fight while a noticeable dummy is used moments later. It doesn\u2019t seem like one of those on-purpose moments for laughs either, but rather a poor editing job or was rushed due to time constraints. But at least the POV shots inside the microwave and fridge during this fight are fun.\r\n\r\nThe action comedy feels like someone cut out the middle portion of the Kill Bill films and presented it as one film. Love Hurts is about a guy who used to kill people for his brother, but eventually got out. He fell in love with the last target he was supposed to kill, staged her death, and got them both out. Then he started a new life as a realtor.\r\n\r\nThe film makes it a point to portray the fact that you can\u2019t outrun your past, but that line alone makes Love Hurts feel so predictable. Rose (Ariana DeBose), is the woman Marvin fell in love with who has returned for revenge. But she forces Marvin back into life for selfish reasons and it seems like she doesn\u2019t love him at all. She only uses him for his ability to kill. She treats him like dirt the entire film and ruins his life all because she doesn\u2019t want to run and hide anymore\u2014hardly the actions of someone who reciprocates admiration for another individual.\r\n\r\nAn accountant named Kippy (Rhys Darby) is captured by Rose to locate $4 million which was part of the cause of why Rose went into hiding. While Kippy is tied up, two of his teeth are ripped out when the duct tape over his mouth is removed. But the mouthpiece looks like it was the cheapest one they could find because it looks like the jagged and oversized hillbilly teeth you normally find in a plastic baggy at a Halloween costume store.\r\n\r\nLove Hurts is watchable because of Ke Huy Quan and the film features some decent action. However, the humor is juvenile and total cringe and the story is total butts. The characters in this film don\u2019t have arcs. They have U-turns and straight lines. This is unfunny mediocrity with fast-punching turbulence and that hurts almost as much as the title of this film.",
            "\u201cMarv\u201d (Ke Huy Quan) is a cheery real estate agent who\u2019s just won an award for his sterling efforts when he receives an unwelcome visitor at his office. \u201cThe Raven\u201d (Mustafa Shakir) is a poet, he loves his verse - but he\u2019s also an useful man with his knives too, and after a few minutes we begin to suspect that this meek little estate agent has really got all the ninja skills of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d. It transpires that he used to be an enforcer for his sibling \u201cKnuckles\u201d (Daniel Wu) who has been mixed up with some Russians and is now worried that \u201cRose\u201d (Ariana DeBose) has managed to wheedle some information from his missing accountant \u201cKippy\u201d (Rhys Darby). Now she is supposed to have been killed already, but big brother is sceptical and because \u201cRose\u201d and \u201cMarv\u201d have some past, it\u2019s going to be down to him to find her before she finds him! The first ten minutes of this are quite good fun as it pokes some fun at the faux-sincerity of the \u201cGlengarrry Glen Ross\u201d brigade but thereafter it all just descends into a rather farcical affair with it\u2019s lightly-comedic and repetitive fight scenes destroying some perfectly good fitted kitchens. Sean Astin features briefly, but to no real purpose as the cat and mouse game vacillates between the two teams and some family menace ensues. DeBose tries hard, for that matter so does Quan, but the story is the stuff of a very weak Jackie Chan affair that rumbles along predictably and without much charm. It\u2019s short, which is a good thing, and it\u2019s not un-watchable, but it\u2019s not good either.",
            "This movie starts off like a comedy, which is fine if that\u2019s what it\u2019s aiming for, but when you go in expecting action and get slapstick humor instead, it feels off. The tone is all over the place. The story follows Marvin Gable (Ke Huy Quan), a former hitman turned real estate agent, but it doesn\u2019t do much with that concept. It throws him into a situation where his past comes back to haunt him, yet there\u2019s no proper setup, no real stakes, and no explanation for why things happen the way they do. The transitions are rushed, and the pacing feels like the script was pieced together without a clear vision. There\u2019s barely a plot, just a series of chaotic events with little to no build-up.\r\n\r\nThe directing is a mess. Scenes escalate with no logic, and major moments happen so fast they don\u2019t have any weight. Cinematography is just as frustrating, especially with the camera constantly circling Marvin whenever he\u2019s deep in thought, which happens way too often. At one point, the movie spends nearly half of the second act on him repeating that he needs to \u201cface his past.\u201d It\u2019s exhausting. The fight scenes aren\u2019t much better. One guy throws knives at the ground, what was he aiming at exactly? others conveniently forget they have guns, or they point straight and shoot as if they're part of a first person shooter game. The action is so choreographed and predictable that it loses any tension.\r\n\r\nThe acting doesn\u2019t help either. Ke Huy Quan does his best, but the role just doesn\u2019t fit him. The supporting cast feels like they\u2019re forcing their performances, especially in the few moments where the movie tries to develop its characters. It\u2019s like they added emotional depth as an afterthought instead of making it feel natural. Then there\u2019s the script, which is a whole other issue. The dialogue is repetitive, with Marvin narrating every single thing he\u2019s about to do instead of just doing it. It makes the movie feel dumbed down, as if the audience needs to be spoon-fed every thought and decision.\r\n\r\nEven the music choices are questionable. The score doesn\u2019t match the tone of the scenes, making everything feel even more disconnected. It\u2019s as if someone randomly picked tracks without considering how they fit into the story. By the time the big climax rolls around, the movie has already lost all sense of direction. When Marvin finally fights his past (literally and figuratively), it plays out in the most ridiculous way possible, with one-on-one fights that ignore any logical strategy. In the end, Love Hurts is a frustrating watch, disjointed, poorly executed, and lacking any real impact.",
            "Despite the undeniable talent of Ke Huy Quan and Ariana DeBose, LOVE HURTS is a painfully generic action-comedy that does little to justify its rather short presence. While both actors bring their usual charisma and commitment, both are left stranded in a film that lacks creativity, effective humor, and even a basic sense of narrative cohesion. The occasional well-executed fight sequence provides fleeting moments of excitement, but they aren't nearly enough to compensate for the bland storytelling and underdeveloped characters. For a movie that leans so heavily on the concept of blending action with comedy, it fails to deliver enough of either to make the experience remotely engaging.\r\n\r\nWhat's most frustrating is how LOVE HURTS squanders its potential at every turn. The script feels like a first draft that never went through the necessary rewrites, riddled with incoherent plot points and lazy storytelling choices. There just isn't enough here to latch onto. The action isn't frequent or inventive enough to impress, and the comedy lands with a dull thud more often than not. By the time the credits roll, the only real takeaway is how much better both Quan and DeBose deserve.\r\n\r\nRating: D+"

            "<em>'Presence'</em> holds uniqueness in regards to how it is filmed, which is very effective, though its story does end up being quite straightforward - and more teen drama-ry than anticipated. All the same, I did enjoy myself whilst watching it unfold across 85mins, pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe cast are also a strong point of this film. Lucy Liu and Eddy Maday are decent, though Callina Liang and Chris Sullivan are the definitive standouts - both t'rific. West Mulholland is solid in his role, even if I'm not absolutely sold on everything that goes on with his character.\r\n\r\nInteresting that this closely follows the release (at least in the UK) of Robert Zemeckis' <em>'Here'</em> - two films shot in original perspectives. This Steven Soderbergh picture isn't quite as high class as that one, but all in all is worthy of a watch; especially with such a short run time.\r\n\r\nThanks to the aforementioned, I was able to watch this at the cinema shortly after finishing Mel Gibson's <em>'Flight Risk'</em>. You could say both do have a feel of being made-for-streaming (this feels <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/r96sk/list/ranked-welcome-to-the-blumhouse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Welcome to the Blumhouse</a>-esque), but I will never moan about the ability to watch movies on the big screen.",
            "A family move into a new home - now I did like the meandering corridors and design of this spacious plot, but quickly we discover that it's a paper thin fa\u00e7ade for four people who are struggling to get over a trauma. Nope, nothing new so far and, indeed nothing new to come either as daughter \"Chloe\" (Callina Lang) falls for the rakish \"Ryan\" (West Mulholland) who is the new best friend of her hunky, charm free and brain dead brother \"Tyler\" (Eddy Maday). Pretty swiftly, they are at it but simultaneously she starts to feel that she is being watched. Things move about on their own, her brother's room gets trashed and even the woman they bring in to do the \"Madame Arcati\" thing thinks something isn't right with the place and it's old silver nitrate mirror. Next thing... Well you'll have to watch it and see, but for me the opening couple of minutes of hand-held POV photography really put me off - especially it's use of the fish-eye, scene-stretching, lenses which people don't actually possess. It made me feel slightly seasick and I couldn't decide if it was a drone cam or a very sure-footed person gliding silently about the place giving us a repetitive third party perspective into the family's lives. Mum (Lucy Liu) rarely puts her laptop down; dad (Chris Sullivan) sort of lumbers around rudderless; the brother is a bit of an attention seeking idiot and finally, the daughter is a moody and uninteresting teenager trying to deal with some baggage about which we learn more, later. The parents come across as a couple who would never in a million years have chosen each other in the first place. At least the production doesn't try to hoodwink us with repetitive visual effects, but what we are left with here is a dialogue heavy story that ends all too abruptly as if the short story it's adapted from just ran out of ideas. Disappointing, sorry.",

            "Diehard fans of horror films have often complained that releases in this genre don\u2019t get the kind of respect they deserve, almost as if they\u2019re the Rodney Dangerfield of moviemaking. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a reputation that\u2019s frequently deserved given that many of these offerings are formulaic, predictable, tedious and needlessly gratuitous. The emergence of \u201csmart\u201d horror films has helped to offset this somewhat, imbuing these pictures with a degree of maturity and respectability that has long been sought but lacking. But, if these films truly want to earn the kind of esteem that their followers crave, these productions have to get better at doing what they do, yet the efforts that go into yielding such results all too often come up short, as is the case in this latest project from acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh. In all honesty, this attempt at creating an elevated version of a prototypical haunted house story leaves much to be desired. When a family of four moves into their new suburban home, strange happenings begin to occur, nearly all of which affect Chloe (Callina Liang), a troubled teen who recently lost her best friend under mysterious circumstances. But she\u2019s not alone in her troubles \u2013 her parents, Rebekah (Lucy Liu) and Chris (Chris Sullivan), are having marital problems and her older brother, Tyler (Eddy Maday), is wrestling with behavioral and attitude issues. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s really going on with everybody, but then that\u2019s where the problem lies with this largely unfocused snooze, one that does little justice to its label as a horror film. For starters, much of it is boring and slow, especially at the outset, taking its own sweet time to get off the ground (almost half of the movie in fact). Then there\u2019s the lame and often-cryptic dialogue, which fails miserably at encouraging viewer engagement or moving the narrative along. And, perhaps most egregiously, the picture drops the ball when it comes to what movies in this genre are supposed to do \u2013 provide the audience with good frights. In fact, there\u2019s precious little in this film that can be considered \u201cscary\u201d; it\u2019s more suspenseful, if anything, but even that is significantly watered down. Finally, when \u201cthe big reveal\u201d comes, it\u2019s not so much frightful as it is implausible and of questionable taste \u2013 wholly inappropriate for and not particularly in the spirit of what should constitute a good haunted house story. The result is a huge cinematic disappointment, one that makes viewers wonder what the point of it all is supposed to be. Admittedly, the film features some intriguing camera work, but it ultimately does little to shed meaningful light on the narrative, particularly in \u201cdepicting\u201d the mysterious presence responsible for all of the supernatural goings-on and its relevance to the characters or the intent behind this story. I must confess to being somewhat baffled by the filmmaker\u2019s involvement in this project as its quality is a far cry from that of most of his previous efforts. Even more so, though, \u201cPresence\u201d does little to move the needle in bolstering the reputation of a genre looking to make a better name for itself. I\u2019ve seen scarier and more compelling TV commercials than this woefully anemic offering, and, because of that, it\u2019s done little to change my opinion of movies of this ilk.",
            "Written by David Koepp (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Mummy 2017) and directed by Steven Soderbergh (Logan Lucky, Side Effects), Presence has an intriguing concept that doesn\u2019t completely work in its execution. Shot in three weeks almost entirely in one location with a $2 million budget, Presence is a creative powerhouse that lacks a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nAll of Presence is from the perspective of an entity in a suburban house. The supernatural thriller seemingly has no close-ups while the cinematography is different in a way that seems like it was shot with a slight fish-eye lens. A family, The Paynes \u2013 Rebekah (Lucy Liu), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Chloe (Callina Liang), and Tyler (Eddy Maday), moves into the empty house revealed at the beginning of the film.\r\n\r\nThe snafued relationship between The Paynes is palpable as soon as they\u2019re introduced. Rebekah is committing financial fraud and her husband Chris is contemplating separation or divorce. Rebekah also prioritizes her older son Tyler and his athleticism in swimming over her younger daughter Chloe who she barely acknowledges. Meanwhile, Chris is concerned for Chloe since her best friend abruptly died and she still hasn\u2019t gotten over it.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a horror or supernatural film from the perspective of the ghost or entity is insanely cool, but the issue here is that this presence isn\u2019t given much to do besides witness people have sex and argue. \r\n\r\nThere are expected supernatural elements here like doors mysteriously opening or closing on their own, a stack of books floating in the air one by one and being stacked neatly on a nearby desk, and shelves and posters being ripped off the wall.\r\n\r\nBefore The Paynes arrive, the first scene of the film is supposed to be this entity wandering around an empty house. It\u2019s fascinating at first but becomes dizzying and nauseating, which may represent the claustrophobic aspect of being trapped somewhere with no escape but still not entirely fun to watch.\r\n\r\nPresence features the first truly nasty on-screen character of the year in Ryan (West Mulholland). Ryan is a popular classmate of Tyler and a drug dealer. He gets romantically involved with Chloe and tries to appear as nonchalant and supportive. \r\n\r\nCracks bubble up to the surface early on as he loses his temper often and his rambling typically sounds like a villain attempting to explain their evil plan in detail to a subdued victim.\r\n\r\nThe film's editing is bizarre since most sequences either feel like one-take or suddenly shift to black before the next scene. Presence is presented like a bunch of scenes randomly stitched together that just happen to make a semi-coherent story. \r\n\r\nThe acting in Presence is fine, but two of the four Payne family members are complete assholes while the other two are pushovers. So it\u2019s difficult to be invested in any of their character developments truly.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the entity in the film is deeply connected to grief and trauma, which allows people who have almost died or experienced something truly traumatic to see or feel someone who has died. \r\n\r\nA medium is brought into The Payne's home after everyone but Chris stops making fun of Chloe\u2019s encounters with the entity. The medium does little for the film apart from solidifying that Chloe isn\u2019t making it up and drawing attention to an item in their living room that will be a part of the last scene in the film.\r\n\r\nThere is a unique concept in Presence that hasn\u2019t entirely been explored in the genre with captivatingly different cinematography and a talented cast to keep you intrigued. But there aren\u2019t enough actual horror elements in Presence to be scary and the family drama is mostly uninteresting apart from this entity being a part of their lives. \r\n\r\nPresence is a close-but-no-cigar thriller with unusual camera tricks and everyone staring off slightly to the left or right to drive its sense of mystery.",
            "Presence (2024) takes a unique approach to the haunted house genre, putting you in the perspective of the ghost itself. The story follows the Payne family as they move into a new home, each carrying their own personal struggles. Chloe, the daughter, is grieving the loss of her best friend, while her mother, Rebekah, is dealing with legal troubles that aren't fully explained. The film plays with the idea of an unseen presence observing their lives, but it never fully confirms whether the ghost is actually the girl Chloe lost or someone else. While the concept is intriguing, the film could have explored the ghost's story more deeply rather than leaving it so ambiguous.\r\n\r\nSteven Soderbergh\u2019s direction is creative, using floating camera movements to make you feel like you're silently drifting through the house, watching events unfold. The cinematography adds to the eerie atmosphere, but the editing choices, especially the long black transitions, interrupt the flow. These moments break immersion instead of adding to the tension. That said, the way the film manages to avoid showing the camera operator in reflections is impressive, proving the level of care put into the visuals.\r\n\r\nLucy Liu gives the strongest performance, bringing depth to Rebekah's character, while Callina Liang does a solid job as Chloe, capturing her grief and confusion. The rest of the cast is decent but nothing particularly stands out. The script does a good job at building tension within the family, though some lines feel a little too on the nose. The score works well, subtly enhancing the eerie tone without overpowering the film. Presence is an interesting watch with a fresh perspective, but it could have benefited from a deeper dive into its ghostly mystery and a more refined edit to keep the pacing tight.",
            "I'm having a hard time to give this movie more than 5 stars. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either, just an average movie. Sadly it wasn't scary at all. The only thing I loved about this movie were amazing soundtracks. Those soundtracks deserved better horror movie than this."

            "Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!\r\n\r\nThere are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nReynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.\r\n\r\nAs noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.",
            "_Deadpool & Wolverine_ is the best the MCU has been since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.

            "In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom\u2019s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering\u2019s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy\u2019s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don\u2019t. I suppose that\u2019s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren\u2019t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture\u2019s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise\u2019s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn\u2019t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I\u2019d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",
            "Such a fun watch, maybe one of the best experiences I've had in a theater. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to 24 year old franchise.",
            "Well the \"Deadpool\" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old \"Dead\". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed \"Wolverine/Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing \"Paradox\" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down \"Cassandra Nova\" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of \"Xavier\" who presides over the void. That's a \"Mad Max\" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by \"Paradox\" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",
            "Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film\u2019s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman\u2019s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it\u2019s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film\u2019s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.\r\n\r\nDespite its comedic approach, the film doesn\u2019t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool\u2019s irreverent humor doesn\u2019t clash with the MCU\u2019s established tone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It\u2019s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",
            "It feels a bit rushed... but then it was rushed.  It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for \"Not Being Gay Enough\" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: \"They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it.\" Which, in turn, translates to \"Actually entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.\r\n\r\nOnly.... it's meh.

And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.\r\n\r\nSo when a movie like this comes along, it is a wonderful thing.",
            "Satisfying and 100% fan-service. Hugh Jackman still is awesome as Wolverine and gives it his all, along with Ryan Reynolds, both showing passion for the characters. That said, much like Deadpool 2, I'm not sure if I have much desire to revisit anytime soon. **3.5/5**",
            "I just watched Deadpool & Wolverine, and wow, it was an absolute blast! Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have incredible chemistry that makes the whole movie work. Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's gruff seriousness balance each other perfectly. The film is packed with hilarious jokes, epic action sequences, and so many Easter eggs that comic book fans will be thrilled.\r\n\r\nThe opening sequence had me hooked right away, with a mix of intense fighting and Deadpool's signature humor. The constant fourth-wall breaks were spot-on and kept the laughs coming. It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by. Whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on all fronts. Don't miss it!",
            "For devout Marvel fans only.\r\n\r\nHere is a test for franchise films: Remove the IP and characters to see if the story, character development, etc. stands on its own without using the IP as a crutch.\r\nIf you remove the IP in this case, you have absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nIf you've seen a lot of previous Marvel films in this universe, you will be treated with an abundance of fan service. Admittedly, I have not watched a lot of these films. I have, however, watched the first two Deadpool entries. I enjoyed them at the time, especially the first one.\r\n\r\nIn this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.\r\nThis film is an almost non-stop barrage of bickering and snarky jokes, but it's never given any time at all to breathe. The few moments where it actually tries to convey emotion, it never truly lands, as all it wants to do is tell jokes. Did I laugh here and there? Sure. But I can count it on one hand.\r\n\r\nThe villain and plot quite forgettable, and you never truly feel that something's at stake, as the threat is mainly conveyed as a progress bar on a screen...\r\n\r\nEven though some people might marvel at Deadpool taking potshots at the MCU, Disney knows exactly what they're doing, and they will be laughing all the way to the bank. Corporate brand maintenance is all it is.",
            "the definition of fun",
            "I went to see Deadpool & Wolverine last evening and boy did it feel refreshing to see Ryan Reynolds making all of these funny jokes on screen as Deadpool. There were a lot of mentions of Marvel, jokes about production companies & about production crew/cast (extras, etc). As someone who's passionate about this industry and is very active in the business, this film is a big success in my opinion. I loved that we got to see Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan in the intro of the film, just sad we didn't get a little Tony Stark (RDJ) appearance, but hey, it's not his movie after all (RIP Iron Man).",
            "Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.\r\n\r\nMarvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.\r\n\r\nThe dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?\r\n\r\nPrepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.\r\n\r\nWhile the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. \r\n\r\nOverall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!",

            "I personally enjoyed it. It was a fresh splash of the recent flops of Marvel movies. The plot was a little disorganized, but overall great film. The nostalgia and love letter to Fox/pre MCU films was a nice touch.",
            "If you enjoyed any films from the early 2000's Fox Marvel Universe, you'll appreciate this film especially. Lots of call backs, and cameo's mixed with modern day references, and even some references to the actor's/actresses real lives. The dialogue is heavy with all of it, and it comes rapid fire, so listen close.\r\nThere's also a sh*t load of profanity and bloody violence, so be aware of that as well. As long as you're not too squeamish, it should be a great flick.",

            "**Deadpool & Wolverine: A Comic Book Dream Realized**\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ bursts onto the screen with the chaotic energy and irreverent humor fans have come to expect from the Merc with a Mouth. This film feels like a love letter to comic book enthusiasts, seamlessly blending the zany, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, emotionally charged presence of Wolverine. The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.\r\n\r\nHugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we\u2019ve longed to see. The sight of Wolverine finally donning his classic costume and charging on all fours is a visual treat that elicited cheers from the audience. Jackman\u2019s performance is a testament to his deep connection with the character, proving once again why he's considered one of the best actors of our time.\r\n\r\nRyan Reynolds' Deadpool is as quippy and meta as ever, and the film strikes a delicate balance between humor and heart. The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool's farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nThe film's action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character's unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, \"Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,\" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.\r\n\r\nThe story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations. This approach keeps the focus on the characters and their journeys, making for a more engaging and enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\n_Deadpool & Wolverine_ isn't just a comic book movie; it's a celebration of the Marvel Universe's rich history and a heartfelt send-off to characters we've grown to love over the years. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual viewer, this film is an emotional whirlwind that invokes nostalgia and opens your heart to the possibilities you imagined as a kid. It's a fitting tribute to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a testament to the enduring appeal of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. This movie is sure to be remembered as one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true comic book dream realized on the big screen.",

            "The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a \"better\" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.\r\n\r\nThe film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic \"fourth act\" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "For a film that\u2019s laser-focused on the human body, it\u2019s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. \r\n\r\nEggs are the \u2018giver of life\u2019, right? They\u2019re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked \u2013 not by a fork, but a syringe.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival.\r\n\r\nTo call the film \u2018bold\u2019 is a weapons-grade understatement. It\u2019s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn\u2019t laugh, you\u2019d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.\r\n\r\nHere's our deep dive for good.film: https://good.film/guide/holy-sh-t-the-substance-is-a-weapons-grade-takedown-of-the-male-gaze",
            "Demi Moore's performance in The Substance is so potent that it's hard to tell what's more intoxicating; her inevitable Best Actress win or Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp screenplay that's already got the Oscar in the bag.",
            "There\u2019s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film\u2019s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that\u2019s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members\u2019 patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn\u2019t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering \u201cTitane\u201d (2021). It also shamelessly \u201cborrows\u201d elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from \u201cThe Shining\u201d (1980) and \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d (1974), costume designs from the \u201cHunger Games\u201d franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like \u201cVertigo\u201d (1958). Then there\u2019s the picture\u2019s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture\u2019s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how \u201cThe Substance\u201d captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I\u2019m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than \u201csubstance.\u201d",
            "This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier \"Reality+\" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. \"Elisabeth\" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss \"Harvey\" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best \"Jekyll and Hyde\" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character \"Sue\" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is \"borrowed\" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing \"Harvey\" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised \"Elisabeth\" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled \"beauty\" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.",
            "Certainly an experience!\r\n\r\n<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!\r\n\r\nI think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!\r\n\r\nIf you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture. I may need a lie-down though.",
            "I love French comedic films, and this one is no different. Coralie Fargeat crafted a seemingly simple story on the subject of Hollywood's obsession with youth and beauty, and then directed it right into the status of cult, horror, midnight, grade B (the good kind) movie genre. Brilliant!\r\n\r\nWhile on the face, this movie is about aging out of Hollywood's graces, the script is also laced with interesting subplots: having a proxy that ages for you a la Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, and the subject of shallow self-hate and self-love, along with that \"needy for applause\" character that so many actors have and must either learn to deal, or fail at life.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore is nothing short of awesome here. Dennis Quaid and Margaret Qualley are right up there with her and Fargeat in playing over-the-top choices.",
            "**The Substance (2024)**\r\nA Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time\r\n\r\n\"The Substance\" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.\r\nThe film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.\r\nAt its core, \"The Substance\" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like \"Death Becomes Her\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.\r\nThe narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death\u2014being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.\r\n\r\n**Practical Effects and Gore**\r\nFrom the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love\u2014a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's \"The Fly,\" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.\r\n\r\n**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**\r\nThe color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.\r\n\r\n**Performances**\r\nDemi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.\r\n\r\n**Critique**\r\nWhile the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.\r\n\r\n**Engaging with the Hype**\r\n\"The Substance\" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Substance\" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like \"Gremlins,\" \"Frankenstein,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" and \"Carrie,\" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.\r\nDespite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation\u2014a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, \"The Substance\" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.\r\n\r\n**Extra Thoughts**\r\n- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?\r\n- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.\r\n- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.\r\n\r\n**Final Recommendation**\r\n\"The Substance\" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",
            "\"The Substance\" is something of a cinematic mash up. \r\n\r\nFirst off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of \"Death Becomes Her\". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. \r\n\r\nThe notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.\r\n\r\nThat said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. \r\n\r\nThis work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. \r\n\r\nIn summary, \"The Substance\" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. \r\n\r\nI will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",
            "A disaster. It's an insult to the illustrious careers of Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid, who both deserve far better.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses too heavily on the body of Margaret Qualley's character, Sue, at the expense of delivering a meaningful story or message. The gratuitous gore towards the end seems to be an attempt to align with current trends, but it falls flat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Coralie Fargeat failed to deliver a coherent message, making the movie a missed opportunity for everyone involved.",
            "I\u2019m into strange films, psychological elements, dramas, and gore, but this movie is complete garbage.",
            "Grotesque, diving into the pitfalls of progress and the human obsession with perfection. Visually, it\u2019s remarkable \u2014 its uncanny imagery often leaves you questioning whether you\u2019re thrilled or disturbed.\r\n\r\nHowever, while it\u2019s bold and at times deeply unsettling, it doesn\u2019t quite achieve that elusive \"perfectly balanced (as all things should be, cit.)\" quality.\r\nThe narrative occasionally stumbles, with gaps that detract from its overall impact.\r\nIt\u2019s thought-provoking but not groundbreaking \u2014 a film that\u2019s above average, yet just shy of excellence.\r\n\r\nAnd I like to imagine that the director somehow died during the making of the movie and was secretly replaced by Yoshihiro Nishimura."

            "It's trash. Don't see it. \r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/Grupid",
            "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it\u2019s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it\u2019s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",
            "If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family \"Gru\" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis \"Maxime Le Mal\" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal \u00dcbelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",
            "The goofy Minions are on the loose again in \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of \u201cstyle over substance\u201d to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.\r\n\r\nFormer supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy.

The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film).

Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.\r\n\r\nNo joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. \r\n\r\nEven the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?\r\n\r\nOn a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",

            "There are times in our lives when nearly all of us exceed the limits of our capabilities (and often quite unexpectedly at that). But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we\u2019re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn\u2019t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don\u2019t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she\u2019s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she\u2019s charged with raising when the gosling\u2019s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture\u2019s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong\u2019o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What\u2019s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it\u2019s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is one of those films that\u2019s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren\u2019t particularly enamored with animation. It\u2019s a feel-good movie that doesn\u2019t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve \u2013 but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.",

            "\"Roz\" is pre-programmed to help. Whatever it is that needs doing, it is there to make it happen - even when it is wrecked on an island populated by animals whose main desire in life is to eat each other. At least the arrival of the \"monster\" manages to galvanise them into one brief moment of hostile unanimity and so when they are not trying to cannibalise it, they are shunning it's efforts to be friends. After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (\"Fink\") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name \"Brightbill\". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as \"Roz\" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter. Each of those tasks comes with it's own hazards but maybe, just maybe, our little team can manage to get project \"Brightbill\" off the ground? No, of course there's no jeopardy here at all, and at times it's comes across as an amalgam of \"Wall:E\" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That's no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it's genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy. It looks great on a big screen and is well worth a gander...!",

I was particularly impressed by the animation style, especially the distinct visual approach tailored to some characters. This creative choice truly makes them shine and adds depth to the storytelling.\r\n\r\nThat said, not every scene felt essential.

            "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley\u2019s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",
            "I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. \"Riley\" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",
            "_Inside Out 2_ is a harmless sequel that is fun for all ages but also absolutely unnecessary. The film recycles three-quarters of the original while introducing a quarter of new characters and ideas.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/PixarClone",
            "Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",
            "This movie is not bad at all. they left to open to more movies and I am good with that they kids haven\u2019t a good franchise since toy store movies so ya I hope they keep making them!!",
            "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar\u2019s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar\u2019s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke\u2019s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler\u2019s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story\u2019s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke\u2019s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn\u2019t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children\u2019s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley\u2019s journey. It\u2019s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",
            "\"Inside Out 2\" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\r\n\r\nThe film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust\u2014offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler\u2019s Joy and Phyllis Smith\u2019s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",
            "Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley\u2019s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie \u2013 Anxiety and Envy, \u2013 besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl\u2019s mind. Compared to \u2018Toy Story 2,\u2019 it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.\r\n\r\nI also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you\u2019re in trouble.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed my experience, check out the <a href=\"https://moviepoptime.com/drama/inside-out-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest Movie Reviews</a>."

            "Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",
            "People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.",
            "Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.\r\n\r\nThe cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\r\n\r\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\r\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\r\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.",
            "\"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.\"\r\n\r\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5/10",
            "This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10/10",
            "That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual \u201cI told you so\u201d wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f\u2026? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\r\n\r\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a \u201csave the human race\u201d mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\r\n\r\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still\u2026) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\r\n\r\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",
            "Again hit produced by christopher nolan after batman.\r\nStoryline is great and also the science theory is perfectly showcased.",
            "This might contain spoilers!\r\n---\r\nInterstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. \r\nThe soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!\r\nThe movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it. I watched the movie 7 times and I still enjoy it!",
            "\"Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light\".\r\n\r\nThe story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called \"Interstellar\" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.\r\n\r\nThe visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.\r\n\r\nNow most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.\r\n\r\nMy only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.\r\n\r\nOverall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.",
            "I will not add another in depth review to the several I see here on this movie. Nor will I try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.\r\n\r\nBut I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn\u2019t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.\r\n\r\nSo the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details.",
            "I've got to say I have been wanting to watch this film for a while now and well it's 2021 and it's a Saturday morning and damn, safe to say this is one of the best films I have ever watched in my life. loved everything about It. The creativity and intelligence put into this film is just mind-blowing considering the fact it is a 2014 film. This clearly shows that mankind will one day achieve the most unexpected and unthought discoveries.\r\nLove and respect to the director Christopher Nolan you are a legend.",
            "It opens my mind after I watched this movie. I have watched it twice to figure out everything on the movie. Basically, this is the movie talking about earth is not a good place to stay anymore. People have to go to space to find another homeland. It reminds me that we will be like them if we didn't care much on environment",
            "As humanity faces an existential crisis, farmer \"Cooper\" (Matthew McConaughey) and his family are fighting a losing battle against an environment determined to destroy what is left of their corn crop. Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by \"Brand\" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot \"Coop\" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of \"Brand\" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (\"Mann\") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what \"humanity\" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates. It's all but three hours long, and there is no denying that it hits a barren spell at times during the middle hour, but for my money this is a Nolan film that does not over-complicate itself and is as good a science fiction thriller as I've seen in many a year.",
            "This mind-bending sci-fi masterpiece took me on an unforgettable journey through space and time. From its breathtaking visuals to the captivating performances, the film had me hooked from start to finish. I couldn't help but be inspired by its thought-provoking themes about love, sacrifice, and the boundless nature of human exploration. \"Interstellar\" truly left me in awe and is an absolute must-watch for any movie enthusiast.",
            "What a cracker!\r\n\r\nSo glad to finally tick <em>'Interstellar'</em> off my theoretical list, took me far too long to get around to it but boy am I glad I finally have done - sensational film! The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... <em>*insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here*</em>\r\n\r\nI'm obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I'm sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it's incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning.\r\n\r\nMatthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I'm shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway.\r\n\r\nI will note one 'but', mind. I didn't love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don't get me wrong at all it's still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really. I thought similarly about (the equally magnificent) <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>'</em>, for example. In short: just a nit-pick, tbh.\r\n\r\nAll in all, phenomenal!",
            "Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" (2014) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a cinematic experience that transcends genre boundaries. It's a breathtaking exploration of humanity's yearning for survival, the profound power of love, and the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe film's greatest strength lies in its seamless blend of a deeply personal story with cutting-edge scientific concepts. We follow Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot turned farmer, who is chosen to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. The film doesn't shy away from complex scientific ideas like wormholes, black holes, and the theory of relativity, but it presents them in a way that is both accessible and captivating. The scene where Cooper encounters his aged daughter while he himself remains relatively young is a poignant example of how the film masterfully intertwines science and emotion, leaving viewers pondering the nature of time and the enduring power of familial bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Interstellar\" is not for the casual viewer. It demands attention, patience, and a willingness to engage with complex ideas. The film's pacing is deliberate, its visuals are stunningly immersive, and its themes are profound. It's a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each watch unveils new layers of meaning and scientific detail. The film's impact is further amplified by Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which perfectly captures the vastness of space and the weight of humanity's fate.\r\n\r\nNolan's direction is masterful, creating a sense of awe and wonder that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. McConaughey delivers a nuanced performance as Cooper, a man grappling with the weight of his mission and the sacrifices he must make. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, also deliver compelling performances that further elevate the film's emotional impact.\r\n\r\n\"Interstellar\" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of human ingenuity, the enduring nature of love, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. It's a film that reminds us of our place in the universe, and the profound interconnectedness of all things. For those who appreciate thought-provoking science fiction with a strong emotional core, \"Interstellar\" is an absolute must-see.",
            "\"Interstellar\" is easily one of the best movies I\u2019ve ever watched, definitely in my top 5 of all time. It\u2019s a masterpiece that feels like every scene matters. Each moment carries an important message, whether it\u2019s about love, sacrifice, or the endless curiosity of humans to explore the unknown. It\u2019s not just a movie, it\u2019s an experience.\r\n\r\nThe performances by the actors were amazing. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper really made me feel every bit of his emotions; his love for his kids, his struggle, and his determination to save humanity. Anne Hathaway also nailed her role, and Jessica Chastain, as adult Murph, was just perfect. Even the smaller roles added so much depth to the movie. It felt like everyone gave their absolute best.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s direction? Flawless. You can see how much thought and care he put into every part of the movie. The production was top-notch, and the visuals of space were breathtaking. Even the robots, TARS and CASE, felt real and practical, not just fancy CGI. Fun fact: those robots were real models controlled by an actor, which is crazy to think about! The black hole, Gargantua, was also scientifically accurate thanks to physicist Kip Thorne, and it looked stunning on screen.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Hans Zimmer deserves its own shoutout. The way he used the church organ and ticking sounds created a mood that\u2019s unforgettable. It felt like the music was alive and part of the story, pulling me deeper into every scene.\r\n\r\nThe movie also taught me things. I love how it\u2019s based on real science, like time dilation and wormholes, but it doesn\u2019t feel boring or like a science lesson. Instead, it made me curious and left me thinking long after it ended.\r\n\r\nOne thing that stood out for me is how the movie shows the power of love and connection. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph was the heart of the story for me. It reminded me that even in the vastness of space, what truly matters are the people we care about.\r\n\r\n\"Interstellar\" isn\u2019t just about saving the world; it\u2019s about what it means to be human. Watching it makes you think about big questions: Why are we here? What\u2019s our purpose? And how far are we willing to go for the ones we love? It\u2019s rare to find a movie that\u2019s this entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again and still find new details to appreciate. It\u2019s honestly hard to put into words how much I love it, but if you\u2019ve seen it, you know what I mean. It\u2019s a masterpiece that stays with you."

            "I thought this came to the cinemas about a month early, but it's still an amiable adventure showcase for Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans. It all starts on Christmas Eve when Santa Clause (J.K. Simmons) is kidnapped from his North Pole home. It's retirement time for his head of security \"Cal\" (Johnson) so he's not best pleased after hundreds of years - and working with \"Zoe\" (Lucy Lui) he has to find out just how his boss's security was compromised in the first place - and then get to the rescuing bit. That search leads them to tech whizz \"Jack\" (Chris Evans) but he hadn't any idea whom his client actually was. After a rocky start, the two men must pull their resources and save Santa before Christmas really does start to deal with all of us on the naughty list. It's got bits of \"Elf\" in it, mingled with some \"Harry Potter\" elements and to be fair to all concerned, they all look like they are having some fun amidst a surfeit of CGI and very tightly choreographed action scenes that mix the modern and the mythological entertainingly enough. Simmons and Liu don't really feature so much and the moral of good vs evil isn't lost in the delivery but it isn't laboured either. Perhaps it's not a movie you will ever remember seeing, but as far as it goes it's a fun vehicle for it's stars to cheer us up as the festivities approach without too much sentiment or cheese.",
            "The star-studded cast, featuring J.K. Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Chris Evans, and Dwayne Johnson, brings a decent level of chemistry to the screen, which is one of the movie's few strengths. While the actors clearly enjoy playing off each other, the story itself is expectedly generic, relying heavily on predictable holiday tropes. The script fails to inject enough fun to offset its clich\u00e9 formulas, and despite its festive intentions, the film feels stuck in cruise control, never quite capturing the magic or excitement one might hope for from a Christmas blockbuster.\r\n\r\nTechnically, RED ONE falters with its visuals. Almost every scene feels confined to a studio setting, and inconsistent VFX work makes it difficult to stay immersed in the story. The action sequences, though admittedly frequent, are mostly dimly lit, which diminishes any potential impact they might have had. None of these set pieces stand out, leaving viewers with little to savor beyond the familiar faces on screen. While it's not as terrible as some have claimed, Jake Kasdan ultimately delivers just another forgettable holiday flick, weighed down by formulaic storytelling and overshadowed - quite literally - by its murky, dark aesthetic.\r\n\r\nRating: C-",
            "Pretty solid festive fare, this.\r\n\r\n<em>'Red One'</em> is perhaps slightly overlong and I didn't sense much chemistry between the cast, though those onscreen still give enjoyable performances and the plot is suitably entertaining whilst giving the necessary Xmas vibes. I was quite impressed with the special effects, I personally thought that side of this flick looked pretty neat.\r\n\r\nDwayne Johnson and Chris Evans are fun enough in this. Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K. Simmons, more than Johnson, plays against type, it's actually unnerving seeing him portray a true good guy - was almost waiting for him to shout down someone's neck, as per.\r\n\r\nKiernan Shipka is decent, as is Kristofer Hivju - I rate their characters. Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess. I can't really fault anyone from the cast though, they all do solid work. If I'm honest, I don't see this film having much of a lifespan in the old memory bank but, nevertheless, I'd still classify it as something worth viewing.",
            "**_Best Christmas Movie Ever!_**\r\n\r\nAfter a key figure is kidnapped from the North Pole city of Myra, the commander of security (Dwayne Johnson) teams-up with a mercenary black-hat hacker (Chris Evans) to locate the victim (JK Simmons). They go to sunny Aruba for answers before entering the creepy lair of Krampus, Santa\u2019s estranged adopted brother. Could the one behind the nefarious plot be the Christmas Witch, Gr\u00fdla (Kiernan Shipka)?\r\n\r\n\u201cRed One\u201d (2024) mixes the Santa Claus mythos with Marvel\u2019s Thor movies for a totally kick-axx Christmas flick. For verification, there\u2019s something similar to the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge in Myra; Gr\u00fdla is akin to Hela; there\u2019s the similar technologically advanced flying crafts; trolls, ogres; and so on. \r\n\r\nThe creativity scores out of the ballpark with one amusing bit after another, such as the Mythological Creatures Protection Agency (or whatever it\u2019s called), the portals in the backs of toy stores, E.L.F., how Santa is able to make it down small chimneys, etc. Then there\u2019s how the movie effectively appeals to both kids and adults, as well as the kids IN adults.\r\n\r\nKiernan Shipka as the antagonist turned 23 during shooting. I knew when I saw her in \u201cTotally Killer\u201d that she was something special. Lucy Liu is also on hand in a fairly beefy role as the security director of Myra.\r\n\r\nIt runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Savannah and Jekyll Island) and Hawaii (Honolulu and Oahu).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A",
            "Red One, starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, had all the ingredients for a holiday blockbuster but missed the mark on nearly every level. Despite its star-studded cast and massive $250 million budget, the movie fails to live up to expectations, leaving both critics and audiences disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe first act feels rushed, skipping meaningful character introductions, and the story quickly falls into a predictable and uninspired plot. Dialogue lacks wit or charm, with most performances coming across as forced, almost like actors reciting homework. While Chris Evans and Lucy Liu offer the best performances of the bunch, they still don't elevate the movie much. The cinematography, sadly, doesn't help either, with over-reliance on weak CGI and clumsy action sequences that fail to impress.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"Red One\" lacks the holiday magic or the action-packed excitement it promised. While it might work as a background movie for casual laughs at its script or acting, it\u2019s hard to recommend for any other purpose. A major missed opportunity for a festive crowd-pleaser."

            "The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire\u2019s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum\u2019s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.\r\n\r\nWith a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch\u2019s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.\r\n\r\nVisually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.\r\n\r\nGiven how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it\u2019s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there\u2019s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.\r\n\r\nFoyProAI doesn\u2019t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer\u2019s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They\u2019ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo\u2019s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.\r\n\r\nThere are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande\u2019s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.\r\n\r\nBut the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it\u2019s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn\u2019t seem that hard.\r\n\r\nSome sequences are thrown in solely because they\u2019ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don\u2019t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero\u2019s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he\u2019s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.\r\n\r\nThe film adaptation seems like it\u2019s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.\r\n\r\nBut the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It\u2019s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.\r\n\r\nWicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don\u2019t match anyone else\u2019s and she\u2019s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.\r\n\r\nWicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it\u2019s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.",
            "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n\r\nI've been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can't wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include \"Wicked Witch of the East\" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I'm excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that's not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I'm very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can't wait to hear her \"I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)\". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I'm so excited to hear \"No Good Deed\" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn't take away from Cynthia's at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don't think it would've been as well done as it was! I can't wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy's Face. 10/10 No Notes.",
            "OK, so I'm going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn't love it. We start where the \"Wizard of Oz\" story finishes off, only without the catchy \"Ding Dong the Witch is...\". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet \"Galinda\" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile \"Wicked Witch of the West\" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - \"Elphaba\" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister \"Nessarose\" (Marissa Bode) to the \"Ozian\" equivalent of \"Hogwarts\" where she encounters the snobbish \"Galinda\" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress \"Madame Morrible\" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince \"Fiyero\" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who's been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that's when things begin to change for an \"Elphaba\" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the \"Emerald City\", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain't going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next \"007\", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written \"Populer/lar\", but the rest of this just struck me as \"Harry Potter\" goes to the musicals where it meets \"Mean Girls\". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there's a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I'd probably just prefer a director's cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre \"Defying Gravity\" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It's a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed by this. Wilted more than wicked, sorry.",
            "It\u2019s quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz \u2013 efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) \u2013 Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it\u2019s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, \u201cWicked\u201d is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that\u2019s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don\u2019t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I\u2019ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that\u2019s a cinematic miracle in itself.",
            "Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.\r\n\r\nAlways impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.\r\n\r\nI have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.\r\n\r\nCynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.\r\n\r\nThe ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.\r\n\r\nThe music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.",
            "https://good.film/guide/haters-will-tell-you-wicked-sucks-heres-why-theyre-wrong\r\n\r\nBroadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage\u2026 but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines \u2013 which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades \u2013 just didn\u2019t work at the movies.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, it\u2019s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isn\u2019t it all a bit\u2026 silly? There\u2019s a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These aren\u2019t exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you\u2019ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.\r\n\r\nLook, we\u2019re not saying Wicked\u2019s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it\u2019s knocking HARD on the \u201ctoo long, wrap it up!\u201d door. And there\u2019s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don\u2019t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn\u2019t have crazy high expectations \u2013 hey, the everyday moviegoer isn\u2019t a hardcore Broadway fan \u2013 but honestly? You don\u2019t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone.

            "I so wanted to hate it.\r\n\r\nI didn't like the decision to split the musical into two films. I didn't like the casting. I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.\r\n\r\nAnd I was wrong.\r\n\r\nErivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) \r\n\r\nIt's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. \r\n\r\nStill, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.",
            "Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character\u2019s struggles, while Ariana Grande\u2019s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story\u2019s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.\r\n\r\nThe musical numbers are undeniably the movie\u2019s highlight. Songs like \"Defying Gravity\" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn\u2019t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.\r\n\r\nOverall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It\u2019s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there\u2019s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it\u2019s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch."

            "\"_There is a devil in this world and I have met him._\"\r\n\r\nThere are parts of this movie I really like. It is almost like gothic poetry painted onto the screen and in a way it is beautiful. Another part of me was a little disappointed with a certain look Nosferatu had. I thought he would looke more like the classic but once I put that aside I truly enjoyed this movie. Lily Depp's physical performance actually surprised me and she deserves some recognition for it.",
            "<em>'Nosferatu'</em> didn't quite hook me, but there is enough about it that I can consider it as a good film. The visuals are splendid, as are the gothic horror elements. On the cast, Lily-Rose Depp impresses, as does (more minimally) Emma Corrin and I'm always happy to see Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\nI do continue to feel quite nonplussed by Nicholas Hoult. I did like him in fellow 2024 release <em>'Juror #2'</em>, but in this I've kinda reverted to feeling unmoved by him onscreen. I'm not entirely sure why as he seems a likeable chap, yet his performances just don't really register - which admittedly sounds harsher than I intended.\r\n\r\nBill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Count Orlok is also a part of this flick that I'm unsure on. Does he look the real deal? Absolutely, no complaints there, but I particularly found the dialogue with him to be a borderline bumbling mess. I found the scenes directly with Count to be the least interesting.\r\n\r\nI would also say that the movie goes on for a bit too long, though I admit that probably is more of a personal shout than one that is to be set in stone; because if you love this, it'll be the perfect length I'm sure. For me, I feel like they went around the houses a tad. With that said, I did highly enjoy that final scene with Depp - very good!\r\n\r\nThose last paragraphs make it sound like I have a dislike for this film. I do not. It just has some noteworthy points that I felt the need to mention. As I type, having not looked at how this has been received, I'd be shocked if this wasn't rated high. Either way, this is worth a watch.\r\n\r\nThis is my third Robert Eggers film. I loved <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10) but I, honestly, hated <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10). Safe to say this falls exactly down the middle, in terms of how I think of it. Quite a stark contrast even so, kinda fascinated to see how <em>'The Witch'</em> hits me when I get around to that at some point.",
            "Incredible acting. No one outshined anyone. Nicholas Hault\u2019s interpretation of genuine fear and loss of faith and strength is commendable. Lily rose depp\u2019s performances over all I see as true sport. I\u2019m inspired. The costuming was splendid. Eggers is great in his choices.",
            "\"Tom\" (Nicholas Hoult) is lovingly married to \"Ellen\" (Lily-Rose Depp) but they haven't much money. That could change, though, as his boss \"Knock\" (Simon McBurney) charges him with a very special mission. He must travel from his German home to the mountains of Carpathia where he must facilitate the sale of a ruined manor house to the reclusive \"Count Orlok\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd). His journey is riddled with portents of suspicion and doom; those he encounters warm him to turn back - but on he goes until he arrives at the castle and is greeted by his enigmatic host. What he thinks is the contract to seal the deal on the house is anything but, as he is soon tormented in his dreams. Many hundreds of miles away, his wife is also suffering - and that causes his best friend \"Friedrich\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to call in \"Dr. Sievers\" (Ralph Ineson) who in turn looks to the scientifically ostracised \"Prof. von Franz\" (Willem Dafoe) for some answers. There are no tangible causes, and the professor quickly concludes that it is evil that's at work and that the continuing and inexplicable absence of her husband, his employer and a recently arrived plague of rats are all part of the supernatural causes of her melancholy. There might be a solution, but that requires an act of supreme sacrifice on the part of the young \"Ellen\", or can her husband and his friends find another way? I'm not really a fan of two-parters, but I think in this case that might have been a better solution for Robert Eggers. We have a brief historical introduction to the Count and to the underlying cause of all of the troubles for \"Ellen\" but for the first hour of the film we don't really develop the characters enough, nor sow the seeds for the mysticism especially well. He relies too heavily on our knowledge of the Galeen story of \"Nosferatu\" (as opposed to the Bram Stoker \"Dracula\" one). I could have done with more depth to that chronology. Once \"Orlok\" is on his voyage and afterwards in the town where his merciless behaviour causes misery and panic, we seem to hit the accelerator and rush to the conclusion as if the cock really were about to crow any minute. There simply isn't time to allow the menace to accumulate. Though the visuals are impressively bleak, most of the acting is remarkably bland. Hoult manages to exude some decent terror now and again, but ATJ is really wooden; it takes too long for Depp to show us what she can bring to this under-exposed character and we just don't see anywhere near enough of the ghoulish \"Orlok\" to understand what this story is essentially all about. It's a gothic, dark, gloomy love story. A story of deceit and betrayal and I wanted more. I wanted to feel a little more invested in the characters: to sympathise, to pity, to fear, even. Perhaps a director's cut is in the offing? It's a great watch on a big screen, but I have to admit to being just a little disappointed.",
            "Visually interesting. Fun to see hands venture over towns. It failed to hold my interest the whole runtime...it's long. It's kind of boring.\r\n\r\nIt's fine. You could probably write an essay about it and be revered if you so desired.",
            "One of the greatest horror films in my opinion. Between the cinematography, cast/acting and the story sticking to original lore; Everything about this movie was masterful. I would go watch it again in theaters if I had the opportunity.",
            "> Standing Before Me Was Death, But I'd Never Been So Happy\r\n\r\n\\- Ellen Hutter\r\n\r\n**Nosferatu** is a chilling gothic horror with top-tier acting and a beautiful set design. The film uses colour and sound better than any other film I've seen recently, and does an incredible job of setting the scene.\r\n\r\nThe movie will scare you, disgust you, and keep you on edge throughout the over two hour runtime. While it isn't something everyone will enjoy, if you think you might enjoy this you shouldn't miss it.",
            "Was pretty decent movie with beautiful visuals. I mean the atmosphere was perfect - cold, dark, gloomy winter. Story was good too. Recently we have been getting some decent horror movies about vampires, like \"The Last Voyage of the Demeter\" which was another great vampire movie.",
            "\"Nosferatu\" tries far too hard to be something, it could more readily have been, with a lighter touch.  \r\n\r\nYou can see what they are going for, a creepy noir, horror fantasy. The problem is, it feels obsessively over stylised, to the point of leaden Gothic oppressiveness. Its a quality that infects the characterisations, as well. They feel over stated, too much larger than life (or is that death) and as a a result, at times, farcical. \r\n\r\nThe story itself, to those who have read Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", is mostly familiar.  A few amendments have been made to bring it more in line with the original  \"Nosferatu\" directed by F. W. Murnau, way back in 1922. Count Dracula has been replaced by Count Orlock, for example. I did feel the ending (which also departs from the novel) was a \"bit thin\" and somewhat underwhelming.\r\n\r\nI will say, in spite of its limitations, I don't hate this film. Its clear a lot of effort and care has been invested into its creation. I think too, certain dramatic and visual aspects of the Gothic film noir approach, are creepily memorable. \r\n\r\nIn summary, \"Nosferatu\" is a valiant effort that would have been markedly better with gentler handling. A balance of the dark aspects of the film with a more subtle, lighter approach would have led to a superior final product. \r\n\r\nUltimately a rather emotionally and visually, cumbersome watch, you might want to spread over a couple of evenings.",
            "Nosferatu (2024) marks the third remake of the original 1922 film, and at this point, you have to wonder, how many times do we need to see this story retold? It\u2019s also part of a ridiculously long list of Dracula-related films, with nearly 95 adaptations floating around. While this version brings fresh cinematography and a chilling atmosphere, it doesn\u2019t reinvent the story in any significant way. The plot follows the familiar beats of Count Orlok\u2019s eerie presence and growing obsession, but it takes its time getting anywhere. The directing leans heavily into gothic horror, which works for setting the mood, but sometimes it feels more focused on aesthetics than storytelling.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is stunning. The cinematography is easily its strongest aspect, with haunting lighting, deep shadows, and eerie textures that create a cold, unsettling world. The acting is another highlight, with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd delivering a terrifying and tragic performance as Orlok. The rest of the cast holds their own, adding depth to the horror. However, the script is where things get shaky. Some moments shine, but others feel drawn out or unnecessarily stiff, making the film drag in parts. The score does a solid job of building tension, though it doesn\u2019t always hit as hard as it could.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest creative choices is the inclusion of an oud and belly dancing in Transylvania during Thomas Hutter\u2019s arrival. The scene is heavily choreographed, with villagers giving him a grand welcome that feels eerie and almost ritualistic. It\u2019s a visually striking moment, but the film never explains its purpose. The oud and dance are Middle Eastern cultural elements, not something tied to Transylvania\u2019s history, and after this elaborate introduction, they are never mentioned again. A single question about it is quickly dismissed, making it feel like the filmmakers threw it in for exoticism without considering whether it made any sense. Nosferatu (2024) is a visually impressive and well-acted film, but its slow pacing, script issues, and odd cultural inaccuracies hold it back. If you\u2019re a fan of classic vampire horror, it\u2019s worth a watch, but it doesn\u2019t do much to stand out from the dozens of Dracula films that came before it.",
            "**_Basically, Robert Eggers\u2019 version of Coppola\u2019s \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u201d_**\r\n\r\nIn 1838, a newlywed couple living in a town on Germany\u2019s coast on the Baltic Sea are challenged by the troubling dreams of the wife (Lily-Rose Depp) and the husband\u2019s long business trip to Transylvania (Nicholas Hoult). The excursion to the castle of Count Orlok (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) takes an utterly frightening turn, but the worst is yet to come when the Count makes it to his decrepit manor in Wisburg.  \r\n\r\n\u201cNosferatu\u201d (2024) was written & directed by Eggers, who was inspired by Henrik Galeen's screenplay for the 1922 film, as well as Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. There are also bits borrowed from \u201cSuspiria\u201d (1977), \"Castle Freak\" and various possession flicks, like \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, I was most reminded of Coppola\u2019s 1992 version of the story. All the main characters are in both movies, just with different names and the Eastern Europe locale switched from London to the fictional Wisburg, Germany. Instead of Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing you have Willem Dafoe as von Franz; in place of Tom Waits as Renfield, there\u2019s Simon McBurney as Knock; instead of Sadie Frost as Lucy, there\u2019s Emma Corrin as Anna; and so on.\r\n\r\nLike Coppola\u2019s movie, the production quality is first-rate. Yet this is way scarier and unsettling and, definitely, the creepiest version of the Dracula I\u2019ve seen on film. But it\u2019s not as lush, sexy or entertaining as \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula,\u201d not to mention Frank Langella\u2019s 1979 version and many of the Hammer flicks. While this lacks the infamous love story that Coppola & writer James Hart added to Stoker\u2019s tale, it still has something akin to that with Orlok\u2019s attraction to Mina, um, I mean Ellen (Depp).\r\n\r\nIt kept my interest for the first half, but started losing it in the second (Coppola\u2019s film had the same issue, just not as much). Yet I liked the ending; and the real European locations are preferred over Coppola\u2019s studio-bound sets (which were top-of-the-line; I just favor real locations).\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, with the Extended Cut running four minutes longer (which is the version I saw). It was shot in the Czech Republic at Barrandov Studios in Prague with location shooting done at Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem Castle and Pern\u0161tejn Castle, as well as Prague's Invalidovna complex. In addition, some exterior shots were done in Corvin Castle in Romania. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-"

            "I suppose that many of us have had the god-squad on the doorstep trying to peddle their philosophising but I doubt many are quite as prepared, or as tempting, as the butter-wouldn't-melt \"Reed\" (Hugh Grant) when the enthusiastic sisters \"Barnes\" (Sophie Thatcher) and \"Paxton\" (Chloe East) arrive at his door. Promises of a meeting with his wife and some blueberry pie lure them in and soon they are having a meaningful debate that rather puts the girls on edge. That anxiety only gets worse as there's no sign of the wife and the scented candle proves to have a most unusual, and illuminating, aroma. They conclude that getting out of his home is the best plan, but that isn't going to be straightforward. He has other plans, and they are going to have to play a game of belief/disbelief if they are to have any hope of getting back to their church. The horror aspects of this are not especially interesting - it's a sort of competent hybrid of \"Escape Room\" meets \"Cluedo\". What helps this stand out a bit more is a subtly menacing effort from Grant and the standard of the writing. The conversation between the three for the first half of the film is quite thought provoking in itself. It asks questions that are truly valid and worthy of consideration amongst those of or without organised faith. The assertions around \"iterations\", burgers and games of \"Monopoly\" also raise a few solid questions about carts and horses that I rather appreciated as we are invited to question or evaluate the whole scope of monotheistic religions and their role in our lives. The two women gel well together here too, realising that they are in some sort of peril - both intellectual and physical, and that latter threat is well demonstrated by some creepy settings and creatively used audio. I didn't love the conclusion - I actually found it really quite disappointing, as if Scott Beck had just run out of ideas or didn't quite have the courage of his earlier convictions, but this is the most substantial part I've seen Grant play in a while and he holds it together well. Not your typical psychological drama and worth a watch, I'd say.",
            "This is a gruesome, bizarre, preposterous, and utterly watchable film. It is a twisted cocktail made surprisingly digestible thanks to Grant's impeccably dapper portrayal of pure malevolence. His performance brings a sinister charm that tempers the madness, making the film's more outlandish horrors feel almost refined.",
            "In the new film \u201cHeretic\u201d, two missionaries named Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) spend their days in fellowship and looking to bring new members into their faith. Sister Paxton is the more sheltered of the two as Sister Barnes comes from the East Coast and joined the church through conversion and appears much wiser in the ways of the world to her colleague.\r\n\r\nEager to get her first new member for Sister Paxton; the two venture to visit Mr. Reed (Hugh Grant), who had earlier expressed interest in their church and as such; made his way onto the contact list for the girls.\r\n\r\nA storm arrives at the same time the girls do but unable to enter the home of Mr. Reed without a female being present; they are assured that his wife is baking in the kitchen and accept his offer to come in out of the weather.\r\n\r\nThey find Mr. Reed charming and very well-versed in theology as he says that he has been studying religions for over a decade and his knowledge is very impressive to the girls yet his questions, answers, and tone start to become disturbing to the girls as does the absence of his wife whom he claims is just in the other room.\r\n\r\nLooking for a chance to leave, the girls discover that they are locked in and the house has a metal overlay that blocks their cell signals. Further complicating matters is the increasingly odd behavior of Mr. Reed who insists that they are free to leave at any time yet confronts them with all manner of theological questions, theories, and challenges at every turn.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a chilling exercise in faith for the girls in a gripping film that keeps you guessing all along.\r\n\r\nThe cast is solid and Grant is very good playing against type. This is not the usual psycho slasher that audiences often see in films of this type but a deep psychological game of terror and manipulation as he believes that he is helping the girls see the truth amongst all the dogma.\r\n\r\nThe film does play a bit to Hollywood for my taste in the final act as certain revelations and outcomes went away from the clever premise that had been established in favor of more traditional situations, but the vast majority of the film was chilling, engaging, and captivating and was powered by strong performances all around.\r\n\r\nDirectors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods who also wrote the film; are no strangers to Horror and Suspense as their resumes are filled with some very tense films and have crafted a film that works as an intense thriller.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",
            "No matter what anyone might say, putting lipstick on a pig doesn\u2019t change the fact that one is still dealing with a pig. And that\u2019s very much the case with this dismally failed attempt at smart horror from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. When two na\u00efve Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East) visit the remote home of a creepy, loquacious middle-aged loner (Hugh Grant) in an attempt to convert him, the trio launches into a protracted conversation about the nature of \u201cthe one true religion.\u201d To a certain extent, it\u2019s an intriguing philosophical discussion \u2013 at least for a while \u2013 until it gradually descends into a series of longwinded fits and starts characterized by disjointed, unrelated, unresolved segments that try viewer patience. The dialogue increasingly amounts to a series of overwrought contrivances undermined by implausible character development, particularly among the two supposed innocents who begin spouting lines that are difficult to accept in light of their supposedly gullible, unsophisticated nature and narrow worldview. But then, in a desperate attempt to retain fading audience attention, the picture degenerates into little more than a meandering slasher movie, albeit with better production design than one typically finds in such fare. What\u2019s more, this offering\u2019s exasperating script heavily \u201cborrows\u201d from an endless stream of religious, philosophical and cinematic sources, one even suggesting that this could turn into the second coming of \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d and \u201cMatrix\u201d franchises. And, while Grant and his co-stars genuinely deliver more than capable portrayals of the three principals, even their performances aren\u2019t enough to cover the inherent weaknesses of this material, no matter how much lipstick is applied to it. Considering the foregoing, I\u2019m truly mystified by the much-celebrated response this offering has been accorded given its tiresome narrative and pretentious, largely pointless overall direction, an experiment that just doesn\u2019t work. As a fan of the smart horror genre and its aim of elevating the content of more classic releases in this area of cinema, I\u2019m seriously disappointed that the inspired creators of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (2018) haven\u2019t come up with something better here, an outcome that\u2019s definitely heretical in itself.",
            "Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (65, Haunt, writers of A Quiet Place), Heretic is a so-called psychological horror that is disappointing on all fronts. After only seeing the trailer once months ago, I initially thought that Heretic was a film about a serial killer (Hugh Grant) who used his crazy mouse trap-contraption house to lure in religious, door-to-door service people and kill them.\r\n\r\nWhile that is partially the case, Heretic follows two missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher, The Book of Boba Fett) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East, The Wolf of Snow Hollow). The two women go to the house of Mr. Reed (Grant) who has expressed interest in hearing more about their religion.\r\n\r\nAs Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton make their way inside, they soon find themselves trapped in Mr. Reed\u2019s bizarrely intricate home featuring electricity on a timer, a front door that supposedly won\u2019t open again until morning, and that the house being made of metal blocks cell phone signals. \r\n\r\nReed, a theology major with vast knowledge of all religions, claims to have found the one true religion. Whether the two women will escape or if Reed knows what he\u2019s talking about is factors into the cerebral aspect of the film.\r\n\r\nMartin Freeman constantly looked miserable and bored out of his mind when he appeared in films like The Hobbit trilogy or the Sherlock TV series. He suddenly looked like he was having the time of his life when he shifted film genres, plunged into horror, and starred in the 2017 film Ghost Stories.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the same case for Hugh Grant. While this isn\u2019t his first horror film, Heretic is his first film in the genre in 36 years (Grant starred in The Lair of the White Room in 1988). Grant is noticeably lively in his performance in Heretic though and seems downright giddy to be torturing people.\r\n\r\nWith cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon (Last Night in Soho, The Handmaiden), Heretic has two visually memorable sequences thanks to how they\u2019re shot. When Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton first arrive, Mr. Reed leaves the room to check on his \u201cwife.\u201d While he\u2019s gone, Barnes turns the candle he blew out and discovers what the scent of the candle is. As she slowly turns the candle, the camera turns with it.\r\n\r\nReed has a miniature duplicate of his house complete with little figures that represent Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton. In a sequence when Sister Paxton is trying to run away from Mr. Reed, we\u2019re following her movements in the miniature but it seamlessly transitions from the model to the real thing when she enters the room and slams the door.\r\n\r\nThe method in which Heretic is written is somewhat odd. Not quite horrific enough to be scary with its religion-defying dialogue taking center stage, Heretic is essentially a two-hour sermon attempting to destroy your faith with some splashes of blood and a raggedy woman or two dying in a blueberry pie.  \r\n\r\nIt feels like if you walked into Heretic devoted to the Mormon religion, you\u2019ll walk out of the theater a different person. Mr. Reed\u2019s arguments regarding all religions stemming from the same concept are portrayed in a way that is believable and convincing.\r\n\r\nHe somehow rambles about Monopoly and board games, music, and vinyl records to demonstrate similarities between certain board games, how some songs are essentially the same tunes with different lyrics, and that all religions are more similar than dissimilar.\r\n\r\nWhile the dialogue-driven film can be interesting, it\u2019s also fairly boring. There\u2019s an unsettling aspect to Mr. Reed\u2019s behavior that capitalizes on the tension in the film. But there are also these long stretches where nothing happens besides the next topic of conversation or a weak payoff where someone\u2019s throat is cut with a box cutter or something.\r\n\r\nHeretic is beautifully shot with a stellar performance from Hugh Grant, but its intriguing concept is drowned out by the desire to deconvert the audience and have a lukewarm reveal regarding whatever the one-true religion is. Watching the film is like being trapped in a church of a religion you don\u2019t believe in with an overwhelmingly passionate pastor trying to dissuade you from ever coming back."

While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\r\n\r\nPersonally?

But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!",
            "Best Movie Ever...",
            "***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.

All the pieces were patiently put in place. The payoff? Never did my inner 8 year old think he would ever be watching a movie with Iron Man and Spider-Man sharing the same screen together, but here we are. Avengers: Infinity War is a very fine piece of 'turn your brain off' storytelling, except it actually goes the extra mile to have some intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe all know the film isn't the Endgame, but we're primed and ready for Part 2.

In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!\r\n\r\nDespite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.\r\n\r\nLike <em>'Captain America: Civil War'</em> did, <em>'Avengers: Infinity War'</em> does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from <em>'Doctor Strange'</em> and <em>'Guardians of the Galaxy'</em> - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.\r\n\r\nThere are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I can't wait to see <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em>!",
            "I walked into this frightened that there would be too man characters and the result would be an empty vacant shell of a movie that was pulled in so many different directions it couldn't make sense of itself.\r\n\r\nYay, I was wrong.\r\n\r\nSeriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And the rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population.\r\n\r\nAnd the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, but at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too much so.\r\n\r\nThe Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and laughs,and yet again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is fine if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.\r\n\r\nThe tone was more action than action/comedy...but with \"War\" in the title, you kind of expect that.\r\n\r\nHowever, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know.\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.",

            "The Godfather Review by Al Carlson\r\n\r\nThe Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone\u2019s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone\u2019s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn\u2019t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo\u2019s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo\u2019s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don\u2019s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It\u2019s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola\u2019s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it\u2019s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They\u2019re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won\u2019t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven\u2019t seen this movie yet, it\u2019s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can\u2019t refuse.",
            "The best movie ever...\r\nA masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the story telling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)\r\n\r\nThe 70's were the best years for Hollywood.",
            "While I'm writing this, The Godfather is still beloved by people who love it simply because they are told they have to love it. \r\nIt's written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the \"Mafia\" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.\r\nThis is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.\r\nThe movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. \r\nThere just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It's totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.",
            "When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious \"Corleone\" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother \"Fredo\" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.",
            "Great Movie **Ever**",
            "The Godfather (1972), directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling in film. Based on Mario Puzo\u2019s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola\u2019s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando\u2019s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.\r\n\r\nCoppola\u2019s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the \u201cPrince of Darkness,\u201d enhances the film\u2019s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota\u2019s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.\r\n\r\nA fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nThe Godfather isn\u2019t just a movie\u2014it\u2019s an experience. It\u2019s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it\u2019s a masterpiece in every sense of the word."

            "I suppose that many of us have had the god-squad on the doorstep trying to peddle their philosophising but I doubt many are quite as prepared, or as tempting, as the butter-wouldn't-melt \"Reed\" (Hugh Grant) when the enthusiastic sisters \"Barnes\" (Sophie Thatcher) and \"Paxton\" (Chloe East) arrive at his door. Promises of a meeting with his wife and some blueberry pie lure them in and soon they are having a meaningful debate that rather puts the girls on edge. That anxiety only gets worse as there's no sign of the wife and the scented candle proves to have a most unusual, and illuminating, aroma. They conclude that getting out of his home is the best plan, but that isn't going to be straightforward. He has other plans, and they are going to have to play a game of belief/disbelief if they are to have any hope of getting back to their church. The horror aspects of this are not especially interesting - it's a sort of competent hybrid of \"Escape Room\" meets \"Cluedo\". What helps this stand out a bit more is a subtly menacing effort from Grant and the standard of the writing. The conversation between the three for the first half of the film is quite thought provoking in itself. It asks questions that are truly valid and worthy of consideration amongst those of or without organised faith. The assertions around \"iterations\", burgers and games of \"Monopoly\" also raise a few solid questions about carts and horses that I rather appreciated as we are invited to question or evaluate the whole scope of monotheistic religions and their role in our lives. The two women gel well together here too, realising that they are in some sort of peril - both intellectual and physical, and that latter threat is well demonstrated by some creepy settings and creatively used audio. I didn't love the conclusion - I actually found it really quite disappointing, as if Scott Beck had just run out of ideas or didn't quite have the courage of his earlier convictions, but this is the most substantial part I've seen Grant play in a while and he holds it together well. Not your typical psychological drama and worth a watch, I'd say.",
            "This is a gruesome, bizarre, preposterous, and utterly watchable film. It is a twisted cocktail made surprisingly digestible thanks to Grant's impeccably dapper portrayal of pure malevolence. His performance brings a sinister charm that tempers the madness, making the film's more outlandish horrors feel almost refined.",
            "In the new film \u201cHeretic\u201d, two missionaries named Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) spend their days in fellowship and looking to bring new members into their faith. Sister Paxton is the more sheltered of the two as Sister Barnes comes from the East Coast and joined the church through conversion and appears much wiser in the ways of the world to her colleague.\r\n\r\nEager to get her first new member for Sister Paxton; the two venture to visit Mr. Reed (Hugh Grant), who had earlier expressed interest in their church and as such; made his way onto the contact list for the girls.\r\n\r\nA storm arrives at the same time the girls do but unable to enter the home of Mr. Reed without a female being present; they are assured that his wife is baking in the kitchen and accept his offer to come in out of the weather.\r\n\r\nThey find Mr. Reed charming and very well-versed in theology as he says that he has been studying religions for over a decade and his knowledge is very impressive to the girls yet his questions, answers, and tone start to become disturbing to the girls as does the absence of his wife whom he claims is just in the other room.\r\n\r\nLooking for a chance to leave, the girls discover that they are locked in and the house has a metal overlay that blocks their cell signals. Further complicating matters is the increasingly odd behavior of Mr. Reed who insists that they are free to leave at any time yet confronts them with all manner of theological questions, theories, and challenges at every turn.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a chilling exercise in faith for the girls in a gripping film that keeps you guessing all along.\r\n\r\nThe cast is solid and Grant is very good playing against type. This is not the usual psycho slasher that audiences often see in films of this type but a deep psychological game of terror and manipulation as he believes that he is helping the girls see the truth amongst all the dogma.\r\n\r\nThe film does play a bit to Hollywood for my taste in the final act as certain revelations and outcomes went away from the clever premise that had been established in favor of more traditional situations, but the vast majority of the film was chilling, engaging, and captivating and was powered by strong performances all around.\r\n\r\nDirectors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods who also wrote the film; are no strangers to Horror and Suspense as their resumes are filled with some very tense films and have crafted a film that works as an intense thriller.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",
            "No matter what anyone might say, putting lipstick on a pig doesn\u2019t change the fact that one is still dealing with a pig. And that\u2019s very much the case with this dismally failed attempt at smart horror from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. When two na\u00efve Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East) visit the remote home of a creepy, loquacious middle-aged loner (Hugh Grant) in an attempt to convert him, the trio launches into a protracted conversation about the nature of \u201cthe one true religion.\u201d To a certain extent, it\u2019s an intriguing philosophical discussion \u2013 at least for a while \u2013 until it gradually descends into a series of longwinded fits and starts characterized by disjointed, unrelated, unresolved segments that try viewer patience. The dialogue increasingly amounts to a series of overwrought contrivances undermined by implausible character development, particularly among the two supposed innocents who begin spouting lines that are difficult to accept in light of their supposedly gullible, unsophisticated nature and narrow worldview. But then, in a desperate attempt to retain fading audience attention, the picture degenerates into little more than a meandering slasher movie, albeit with better production design than one typically finds in such fare. What\u2019s more, this offering\u2019s exasperating script heavily \u201cborrows\u201d from an endless stream of religious, philosophical and cinematic sources, one even suggesting that this could turn into the second coming of \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d and \u201cMatrix\u201d franchises. And, while Grant and his co-stars genuinely deliver more than capable portrayals of the three principals, even their performances aren\u2019t enough to cover the inherent weaknesses of this material, no matter how much lipstick is applied to it. Considering the foregoing, I\u2019m truly mystified by the much-celebrated response this offering has been accorded given its tiresome narrative and pretentious, largely pointless overall direction, an experiment that just doesn\u2019t work. As a fan of the smart horror genre and its aim of elevating the content of more classic releases in this area of cinema, I\u2019m seriously disappointed that the inspired creators of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (2018) haven\u2019t come up with something better here, an outcome that\u2019s definitely heretical in itself.",
            "Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (65, Haunt, writers of A Quiet Place), Heretic is a so-called psychological horror that is disappointing on all fronts. After only seeing the trailer once months ago, I initially thought that Heretic was a film about a serial killer (Hugh Grant) who used his crazy mouse trap-contraption house to lure in religious, door-to-door service people and kill them.\r\n\r\nWhile that is partially the case, Heretic follows two missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher, The Book of Boba Fett) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East, The Wolf of Snow Hollow). The two women go to the house of Mr. Reed (Grant) who has expressed interest in hearing more about their religion.\r\n\r\nAs Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton make their way inside, they soon find themselves trapped in Mr. Reed\u2019s bizarrely intricate home featuring electricity on a timer, a front door that supposedly won\u2019t open again until morning, and that the house being made of metal blocks cell phone signals. \r\n\r\nReed, a theology major with vast knowledge of all religions, claims to have found the one true religion. Whether the two women will escape or if Reed knows what he\u2019s talking about is factors into the cerebral aspect of the film.\r\n\r\nMartin Freeman constantly looked miserable and bored out of his mind when he appeared in films like The Hobbit trilogy or the Sherlock TV series. He suddenly looked like he was having the time of his life when he shifted film genres, plunged into horror, and starred in the 2017 film Ghost Stories.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the same case for Hugh Grant. While this isn\u2019t his first horror film, Heretic is his first film in the genre in 36 years (Grant starred in The Lair of the White Room in 1988). Grant is noticeably lively in his performance in Heretic though and seems downright giddy to be torturing people.\r\n\r\nWith cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon (Last Night in Soho, The Handmaiden), Heretic has two visually memorable sequences thanks to how they\u2019re shot. When Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton first arrive, Mr. Reed leaves the room to check on his \u201cwife.\u201d While he\u2019s gone, Barnes turns the candle he blew out and discovers what the scent of the candle is. As she slowly turns the candle, the camera turns with it.\r\n\r\nReed has a miniature duplicate of his house complete with little figures that represent Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton. In a sequence when Sister Paxton is trying to run away from Mr. Reed, we\u2019re following her movements in the miniature but it seamlessly transitions from the model to the real thing when she enters the room and slams the door.\r\n\r\nThe method in which Heretic is written is somewhat odd. Not quite horrific enough to be scary with its religion-defying dialogue taking center stage, Heretic is essentially a two-hour sermon attempting to destroy your faith with some splashes of blood and a raggedy woman or two dying in a blueberry pie.  \r\n\r\nIt feels like if you walked into Heretic devoted to the Mormon religion, you\u2019ll walk out of the theater a different person. Mr. Reed\u2019s arguments regarding all religions stemming from the same concept are portrayed in a way that is believable and convincing.\r\n\r\nHe somehow rambles about Monopoly and board games, music, and vinyl records to demonstrate similarities between certain board games, how some songs are essentially the same tunes with different lyrics, and that all religions are more similar than dissimilar.\r\n\r\nWhile the dialogue-driven film can be interesting, it\u2019s also fairly boring. There\u2019s an unsettling aspect to Mr. Reed\u2019s behavior that capitalizes on the tension in the film. But there are also these long stretches where nothing happens besides the next topic of conversation or a weak payoff where someone\u2019s throat is cut with a box cutter or something.\r\n\r\nHeretic is beautifully shot with a stellar performance from Hugh Grant, but its intriguing concept is drowned out by the desire to deconvert the audience and have a lukewarm reveal regarding whatever the one-true religion is. Watching the film is like being trapped in a church of a religion you don\u2019t believe in with an overwhelmingly passionate pastor trying to dissuade you from ever coming back."

            "Described by Roger Ebert as a \"trapped in a haunted house\" movie, this movie set the bar for Horror in the Summer. \r\n\r\nThe \"Nostromo,\" like \"Star Wars\" spacecraft, looks worn and in use, compared to the \"just out of the box\" look of \"Star Trek\" spacecraft. (And I'm a fan of the \"Star Trek\" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot.\" \r\n\r\nA band of \"space truckers\" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic \"Exomorph.\" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other \"space monster\" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as \"near pornographic,\" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's \"worst nightmare\" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the \"Prometheus\" prequel.(?)",
            "There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated... \r\n\r\nAlien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.\r\n\r\nThe space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",
            "The standard bearer of horror in space, Ridley Scott's masterpiece still thrills new generations of fans. The Giger-inspired alien induces a claustrophobic nightmare that still carries on in sequels and prequels.",
            "<em>'Alien'</em> isn't as eventful, and as such as entertaining, as I had anticipated, though it is still an enjoyable near two hours.\r\n\r\nIt's a strong cast, with newbie Sigourney Weaver putting in a great performance. Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.\r\n\r\nOther positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.\r\n\r\nWill check out the sequels, prequels and spin-offs/crossovers with much intrigue.",
            "Horror in Space, that's what this is. It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.\r\n\r\nBut what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.\r\n\r\nYou can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.\r\n\r\nAnd, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.\r\n\r\nIt's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.\r\n\r\nBut, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is. It's really ONLY a horror movie in space and nothing more. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does make it completely confusing when you read reviews that make it out to be more than an exceptional monster movie.",
            "**One of the great founders of modern sci-fi.**\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows me already knows that I don't really like alien-themed movies, because I don't strictly believe in intelligent life outside our planet. However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. \u201cAlien\u201d is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the \u201cNostromo\u201d, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.",
            "Back in the day before Sir John Hurt took to being little more than a highly paid cameo-man, he was a great actor and here is a prime example. His merchant ship is travelling through space when it receives a distress call. They stop to help and one of their number becomes infected with a... well, now you have to watch it. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense \"Ripley\" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!",

A little flabby in the middle third, but given the huge cast and story to cover it is very understandable.  The highlight was the parings of characters from different stories and their interactions.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't a Marvel fan this film won't convert you, but if you have liked any of the previous films you will like this too.\r\n\r\n10/10",

While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\r\n\r\nPersonally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first _Avengers_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.

But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!",
            "Best Movie Ever...",
            "***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.

In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!\r\n\r\nDespite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.\r\n\r\nLike <em>'Captain America: Civil War'</em> did, <em>'Avengers: Infinity War'</em> does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from <em>'Doctor Strange'</em> and <em>'Guardians of the Galaxy'</em> - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.\r\n\r\nThere are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I can't wait to see <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em>!",

They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And the rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population.\r\n\r\nAnd the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, but at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too much so.\r\n\r\nThe Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and laughs,and yet again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is fine if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.\r\n\r\nThe tone was more action than action/comedy...but with \"War\" in the title, you kind of expect that.\r\n\r\nHowever, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know.\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.",

Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly the first film in a final trilogy. Interpret this last sentence as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",
            "A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, \"Entertain\".\r\n\r\nFast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

            "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",

            "Writing a review for a sequel like \u201cFast X\u201d feels pretty pointless. It\u2019s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I\u2019m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect \u201cFast X\u201d to be a film that\u2019s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It\u2019s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, \u201cFast Five.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember the movie, don\u2019t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He\u2019s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \u201cfamily\u201d are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d The jokes aren\u2019t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier\u2018s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman\u2019s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in \u201cF9\u201d seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there\u2019s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom\u2019s son don\u2019t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m a fan of all things \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. \u201cFast X\u201d feels like it\u2019s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you\u2019re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it\u2019s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",
            "I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters. I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**",
            "This was, of course, a totally ludicrous movie devoid of any pretense of realism or intelligence when it comes to basic science and physics from the script writers. It was however, also a quite fun movie.\r\n\r\nIt is also a movie free from the usual Hollywood far left woke preaching which is, of course, a big plus.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame that there is always a bunch of trolls around giving movies like this single star reviews. I mean, come on, what the fuck did you expect? It is a movie exactly in the same style as the last movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel is Vin Diesel which is a good thing. It is loaded with fun, totally unrealistic but fun, action. I really could have been without Roman\u2019s and Tej\u2019s shenanigans but for the rest I liked the characters and it was nice to see Statham in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhat really made the movie though was to finally see a real, rotten to the core, megalomaniac and charismatic bad guy. Jason Momoa is doing a great job of Dante and I suspect he had quite a bit of fun when doing the role.\r\n\r\nOf course there are a few things that drags down the movie.\r\n\r\nThings like a 20 kiloton nuclear bomb going of a few hundred meters from the Vatican with \u201calmost\u201d no casualties. That is a new low on unrealism even for the Hollywood hacks.\r\n\r\nAnd what bloody passenger airliner has bomb drop style cargo doors under it?\r\n\r\nEven if they did not care about sanity or realism when making the movie there are limits. That drags down the rating as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nAlso, they decided to make this final (?) instalment a two part movie with a huge cliffhanger at the end of this one. I just hate cliffhangers and it makes me automatically reduce the rating.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely know need for it. They could just have Dom & Co walk into the sunset plotting their revenge or something instead of this dumbass ending.\r\n\r\nAt least the good thing is that, unless the Hollywood hacks turns out to be even more stupid than they usually are (which would be quite a feat), part two of this movie will be all about kicking Dante\u2019s arse.",

            "Some birds aren't meant to be caged.\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",
            "Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**",
            "There is a reason why this movie is at the top of any popular list your will find.\r\nVery strong performances from lead actors and a story line from the literary brilliance of Stephen King (and no, its not a horror).\r\nSufficient drama and depth to keep you interested and occupied without stupefying your brain. It is the movie that has something for everyone.",
            "It's still puzzling to me why this movie exactly continues to appear in every single best-movies-of-all-time chart. There's a great story, perfect cast, and acting. It really moves me in times when I'm finding myself figuring out things with my annual tax routine reading <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidsmithjd/what-is-form-w-2-and-how-does-it-work-3n31d\">this article</a>, and accidentally catching myself wondering what my life should be if circumstances had changed so drastically. This movie worth a rewatch by all means, but yet, there's no unique vibe or something - there are thousands of other ones as good as this one.",
            "I will not say that the film is predictable, because it is not quite so, due to the fact that we only know Andy\u2019s intentions at the end, and during the film, it is important to understand that there was not a hint of it, but let's not forget our guys who so imprudently localized it. I will not be the first, but the word 'redemption' is translated as 'redemption'. I don\u2019t know the reason why our localizers decided to spoil the impression to all Russian-speaking people.",
            "First time seeing this in probably close to 20 years, maybe longer. Forgot how excellent of a movie this was, amazing all around from the performances, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins especially, with a roller coaster of emotions. The writing (from Stephen King's novel) direction from Frank Darabont was precise and just all around fantastic. This is the very rare 5 star movies I've given but it is easily one of the best movies, right up there in my book with The Godfather. **5.0/5**",

            "This is much more predictable and Hollywood than a King novel.\r\nThis story of another man wrongfully in prison for murder joins the list of about every other movie about a man sent to prison for murdering his wife.\r\nAnd therein lies the problem. Most of the time, the killer is the husband, and most of the time the right man is in prison.\r\nJuries are now doomed to consist of several people who are brainwashed by this constant propaganda Hollywood gives us and think accordingly.\r\nPeople are not gods. They are souls and spirits that can only withstand so much brainwashing. \r\nAdd to that, the story plods along with really nothing new to add. It's a very formula movie.\r\nI won't say it is a \"bad movie\". Those are ones I give 1 or 2 out of 10. But 3/10 is what I call the very boring, unimaginative, safe, non thought provoking movies that you forget about quite quickly.",

            "Tim Robbins is wealthy banker \"Andy Dufresne\" who finds himself sentenced to life imprisonment after his wife and her lover are found murdered. The handsome \"new fish\" is initially the target of the \"sisters\" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison \"scrounger\" Morgan Freeman (\"Red\"). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including \"Warden Norton\" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King's lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!",
            "**Watched it 32 times**\r\n\r\nCall me obsessed, but I have watched this movie 32 times (and counting) over the past 2 decades. One may wonder why? It is because every time I watch this movie, I learn something new from it. For example, despite being such a good friend of Red, Andy never shares his plan with him. This taught me that discipline and focus is vital for success.\r\n\r\nI can not praise enough the tight plot, direction, acting and everything. On my favorite movies list, this one certainly tops the chart.",

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver unforgettable performances, creating a deeply emotional story of resilience and redemption. With its captivating plot and profound themes, it remains one of the greatest films ever made.",
            "The Shawshank Redemption is one of those timeless classics that pulls you in with its heartfelt storytelling and remarkable performances. At its core, it\u2019s a story about hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit, set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank prison. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red deliver deeply moving performances, capturing the bond that grows between two men confined by walls but freed by hope. Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King\u2019s novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks\u2019 storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time. It\u2019s a stark reminder of how institutionalization can strip people of their ability to live freely, even after they've served their time. That moment, along with Red\u2019s own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story\u2019s broader themes of freedom and redemption.\r\n\r\nThe direction by Frank Darabont is masterful, turning what could have been a straightforward prison drama into something deeply profound. The setting of Shawshank feels both oppressive and oddly serene, perfectly capturing the tone of the story. The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing the characters and their emotional arcs to take center stage. With its pitch-perfect pacing, poetic dialogue, and an uplifting finale, The Shawshank Redemption remains a film that resonates on every rewatch. It\u2019s not just a movie; it\u2019s an experience."

            "This maybe hit the cinemas a month too early as there's a distinctly festive feel to this latest outing for the menacing \"Art\" the clown. He descends upon the townsfolk with blood-thirsty enthusiasm causing some brutal carnage but then he and his equally heinous pal \"Vicky\" (Samantha Scaffidi) go for a long nap. It's a pair of unfortunate demolition guys who provide their wake up entertainment and rejuvenated, they set out in search of \"Sienna\" (Lauren LaVera) and brother \"Jonathan\" (Elliott Fulham) - and woe betides anyone who gets in the way - even if you are dressed as Santa Claus. This is by far the best of the three so far, I think. There's much less repetition with the standard slashing-fayre and a bit more, dare I say, intimacy from our \"Terrifier\" as David Howard Thornton imbues his character with more akin to an emotional and quirky mime artist. There's more sadness, mischief and playfulness as he wields everything from an axe to a chain-saw. Shower sex might never be the same again! It's really the last half hour that gets it moving and though that scenario is largely predictable and I have to say that none of the speaking-part acting here is really very good, the tension mounts nicely and there's an entertaining degree of shock mixed with dark humour and Christmas gifts to raise a smile and maybe the one hair on the back of your neck towards the denouement. Sure, it's formulaic and there aren't so many surprises, but they are getting better and moving away from the Hammer style of ketchup gore and annoying, hysterical, frat-style characters that we've seen before. It's entirely forgettable, and far too long, but I did quite enjoy it.",

It does have some good moments though, while Lauren LaVera and David Howard Thornton again bring strong onscreen showings.",
            "**How \"Terrifier 3\" Redefines Horror Cinema and Mirrors Societal Anxieties**\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\nIn a cinematic landscape often dominated by high-budget blockbusters and familiar franchises, \"Terrifier 3\" emerges as a remarkable exception. Directed by Damien Leone, this low-budget horror film has defied industry expectations by grossing over $82 million worldwide against a modest $2 million budget. Beyond its financial success, the film offers a profound exploration of psychological fears, societal tensions, and subtle political commentary, redefining the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n**A Subversion of Holiday Traditions**\r\nSet against the ironically cheerful backdrop of Christmas Eve, \"Terrifier 3\" subverts traditional holiday themes by delving into the darkest corners of human fear. The malevolent antagonist, Art the Clown - portrayed with chilling intensity by David Howard Thornton - embodies unpredictability and chaos. His reign of terror over Miles County isn't just a series of gruesome events; it's a relentless assault on the notions of safety, normalcy, and the comfort typically associated with the holiday season.\r\n\r\n**Psychological Exploration**\r\nAt its core, the film is a psychological study of fear and human responses to extreme situations. It taps into Carl Jung's concept of the \"shadow self,\" compelling both characters and viewers to confront the darker aspects of their psyche. Art the Clown is not merely a villain; he represents repressed anxieties and the chaotic potential within society. The notably subdued reactions of audiences - such as the silent screening experiences I experienced in CinemaCity in Romania - highlight the film's ability to reach deep into the subconscious, evoking a primal response that transcends typical cinematic experiences.\r\n\r\n**Social Commentary and Contemporary Relevance**\r\n\"Terrifier 3\" serves as a mirror reflecting contemporary societal fears. In an era marked by global uncertainties and the erosion of traditional safety nets, the film's disruption of the holiday idyll resonates powerfully. It challenges the illusion of security in familiar settings, suggesting that chaos can intrude upon life without warning. This theme is particularly poignant given current global anxieties related to political polarization, social unrest, and the fragility of societal structures.\r\n\r\n**Subtle Political Undertones**\r\nThe movie subtly weaves in commentary on the divisiveness and unpredictability that have characterized recent political landscapes, particularly echoing sentiments reminiscent of calls to \"make it great again.\" Even it might be a bit of a stretch interpretation it lands very well and align in reality we are today. Art the Clown's embodiment of chaos and his assault on societal norms can be interpreted as an allegory for the breakdown of traditional structures and the rise of polarizing forces. His relentless terror reflects the disruption of established conventions, forcing communities to grapple with unprecedented challenges - a parallel to the societal upheavals experienced during turbulent political times.\r\n\r\nThe narrative also examines leadership and authority. The inability of societal institutions within the film to contain or comprehend the terror inflicted by Art the Clown mirrors real-world frustrations with ineffective governance in the face of crises. This reflection invites contemplation on how societies become vulnerable when trust in leadership erodes.\r\n\r\n_Note: The interpretations presented regarding the political undertones, are my personal opinions and reflections. Don't get to excited! :)_\r\n\r\n**David Howard Thornton's Masterful Performance**\r\nThornton's portrayal of Art the Clown elevates the character from a mere slasher antagonist to a symbol of deeper psychological, social, and political fears. His ability to convey menace without dialogue relies on physicality and expressive nuance, creating a sinister charisma that is both repulsive and captivating. This performance is instrumental in making the film's thematic explorations resonate so profoundly with audiences.\r\n\r\n**The Appeal of Extreme Horror**\r\nThe film's financial success, despite - or perhaps because of - its extreme gore and brutality, speaks to a cultural fascination with boundary-pushing content. \"Terrifier 3\" taps into the audience's desire for cathartic experiences, offering a space to explore intense emotions and confront the darker facets of humanity. This attraction to extreme horror can be seen as a form of collective processing of fear and uncertainty, providing both an escape from and a reflection of real-world tensions.\r\n\r\n**Implications for the Film Industry**\r\n\"Terrifier 3\" challenges conventional wisdom in the film industry regarding the profitability and impact of low-budget productions. Its success demonstrates that audiences are hungry for content that is innovative, thought-provoking, and willing to push boundaries. The film exemplifies how strategic storytelling and thematic depth can overcome financial limitations, suggesting a shift in how success can be achieved in cinema.\r\n\r\nFor filmmakers and industry professionals, \"Terrifier 3\" serves as a case study in leveraging genre conventions to explore complex themes while engaging audiences on multiple levels. It highlights the potential for horror films to transcend entertainment, becoming vehicles for social commentary and philosophical inquiry.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\"Terrifier 3\" is more than a horror film; it's a bold artistic statement that challenges viewers psychologically, socially, and potentially politically . Damien Leone has crafted a work that is unflinching in its depiction of terror yet rich with depth and relevance. The movie invites audiences not only to experience fear but to question its origins and implications within the context of contemporary society.\r\nAs the film continues to captivate and unsettle viewers worldwide, it redefines the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century. \"Terrifier 3\" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling that is unafraid to delve into the complexities of existence, reflecting and challenging the societal and political currents of our times.\r\n\r\n**\"Terrifier 4\" is just inevitable!**",
            "The weakest Terrifier. Strong performances but the pacing could be better.  The shorter run time is a plus when the story is not as engaging as in the previous ones.",
            "The third installment of Terrifier promised to surpass the expectations of slasher fans, but unfortunately, it falls short due to a script that loses its way halfway through the movie. What begins as an intriguing narrative with potential to explore Art the Clown\u2019s backstory quickly dissolves into a series of chaotic, disconnected scenes that seem to exist solely to justify the excess of gore.\r\n\r\nCharacter development is practically non-existent, and any attempt to offer a narrative arc is abandoned in favor of an endless parade of graphic violence. While the special effects are impressive and true to the visceral spirit of the saga, it feels like an empty spectacle without a story to support it.\r\n\r\nFor fans of extreme gore, Terrifier 3 might meet expectations, but even for them, the lack of coherence in the script and the absence of a solid plot might prove frustrating. What could have been an opportunity to take the franchise to new levels of depth and creativity ends up being an exercise in shock for shock\u2019s sake.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Terrifier 3 gets lost in its own excess, leaving viewers with an empty, exhausting experience that, while visually impactful, lacks narrative purpose."

Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt shouldn't miss any awards ceremonies\u2026 they're absolutely superb, as are the rest of the exceptional actors involved in the movie.\r\n\r\nPacing, structure, and runtime, in addition to its quasi-documentary style and its narrative complexity, make this a difficult, heavy watch that will, for sure, leave some viewers disappointed, bored, or simply tired. Ultimately, Christopher Nolan justifies the use of the expression \"not for everyone\".\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "**OPPENHEIMER IS \"NOT FOR EVERYONE\" AS STATED BY CHRISTROPHER NOLAN BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE FILM HIMSELF. ** But those who have ample knowledge of physics and chemistry, this film is a masterpiece. The film takes the viewer into the mind of the \"Father of the atomic bomb\" how he thinks, how he feels with much accuracy. Nolan beautifully explains his life both on a private and professional front. The music, the sounds with each scene are top notch. The visuals of QUANTUM PHYSICS, FISSION, NUCLEAR EXPLOSION are mind-boggling. \r\n\r\nIf possible, watch it in IMAX. \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE IS FULL OF DIALOGUES, CONVERSATIONS MOVING BACK AND FORTH IN TIMELINE. It's a historical biography with fantabulous acting by C.M., E.B., R.D.J. and more. The scenes with ALBERT EINSTEIN are just wow. A plethora of scientists(BOHR, FERMI, TELLER, HEISENBERG) of the age can be seen throughout.  There are no action scenes if you are in search of that. \r\n\r\nIT IS A CINEMATOGRAPHIC BRILLIANCE. IF U CAN'T WATCH SIENTIFIC HISTORY JUST DON'T GO.",
            "Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that\u2019s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and na\u00efve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist\u2019s life, chronicles his development of \u201cthe gadget\u201d and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer\u2019s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture\u2019s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering\u2019s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",
            "Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the \"Manhattan Project\" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious \"Col. Groves\" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event \"enquiries\" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",
            "This film takes you on an exhilarating journey through history, skillfully weaving together captivating storytelling and breathtaking visuals. The performances were top-notch, leaving me completely immersed in the characters' emotions. A definite must-see!",
            "Cillian Murphy, so hot right now. Film is a little long though.",
            "The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan\u2018s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it\u2019s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\r\n\r\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that\u2019s a far cry from what I\u2019d call \u201centertaining.\u201d It\u2019s a great movie that\u2019s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn\u2019t really worth it.\r\n\r\nNolan\u2019s film is poignant in a way that\u2019s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that\u2019s plaguing society. There\u2019s a very real moral question about humanity\u2019s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan\u2019s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer\u2019s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover\u2019s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won\u2019t be completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn\u2019t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a riveting movie that\u2019s made for thinking audiences.",
            "The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime. Oppenheimer is a biopic that everyone knows the ending to, but thanks to the expert direction and awe-inspiring performances, it is an experience that will leave a lasting impression on you.",
            "> **Oppenheimer:** I feel like I have blood on my hands, sir.\r\n> \r\n> **Truman:** [takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives it to him] You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit about who built the bomb?\r\n\r\nan incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nanytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.\r\n\r\nwent into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.\r\n\r\nthe performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.\r\n\r\nI'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. G\u00f6ransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nanother aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.\r\n\r\nthis film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.",
            "excellent, a perfect example of true defined cinema\r\nAt a whopping three hours long it, very much like LOTR, feels considerably less.\r\nA must watch",
            "Well, with ten other reviews on this site, I am not going to give a blow-by-blow assessment of what I like or don\u2019t like. I am sure other reviews have touched upon hinge I might point out.\r\n\r\nI will only say that I thought it a really good movie: smartly written and nicely acted. I had some trouble following details in places \u2014 not because of the complex time structure (though I admit prefer the straight ahead story style of, say, The Godfather) but rather because I couldn\u2019t get volume up loud enough to hear when the characters spoke softly and/or quickly, and without captions I had to wait for the context of conversations to help fill in what I was missing. It was a shame to have such a little thing in the way of a good movie being great.",
            "The movie is incredibly overrated and filled with unnecessary dramatized scenes, making it excessively long. It presents Oppenheimer as a cliche, portraying him as the world's smartest man who can learn a language in six weeks, accompanied by aggressively written advanced equations on a blackboard with a loud soundtrack.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this film stands as Nolan's second worst movie, following Tenet. It embodies all his negative qualities, and its duration should not have exceeded 1 hour and 40 minutes, stretching unnecessarily to 3 hours.",
            "The most inefficient telling of a story that I have ever experienced. Hugely unnecessary character development and unnecessary dramatisation.\r\n\r\nI only made it to halfway before dyeing of boredom... jumped forward a chunk... saw the president say that the Russians would never succeed in obtaining the atomic bomb (unsure as to what he based this on). The movie was a strong testament to how much the US feared penetration by communism... and the fact that the US fear themselves losing their grip on being 'the leaders of the free world' [a title that they have never deserved or earned]... and the fact that no one has learned anything from history and being in perpetual war.\r\n\r\nTruly a missed opportunity to tell this story in a way that would have any memorable meaning.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the planet is doomed to self annihilation at the hands of the 1% (The love of money is the root of all evil).",
            "I was actually looking forward to watch this movie. Unfortunately I have to say I was rather disappointed when the movie came to an end.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive projects ever undertaken filled with scientifical challenges and performed under immense pressure.\r\n\r\nThat is what the movie should have been all about. Unfortunately it is not. Instead all the science, challenges and achievements are just glossed over and we are feed three long, boring, hours about political machinations and his sex life.\r\n\r\nThat is not what I was expecting and it is definitely not what I wanted to watch.\r\n\r\nTrust Hollywood to turn science into a bloody soap-like drama.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie. His Dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and Interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science.\r\n\r\nI guess I should have lowered my expectations when I saw they gave the movie to him.",
            "Honestly too long. This is really two, long films. The first half deals mostly with the science and the scientists. The second half/film deals with the political and moral repercussions of the science.\r\n\r\nOutside the story, Nolan has given us a top notch cast performing at their peak, beautiful cinematography, and a delicious score.",
            "**Oppenheimer may not be for many people, but it was wonderful for me.** This movie does require some knowledge and interest in science, but it doesn't mean that you have to be an expert. I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie.\r\n\r\n**WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie.**\r\n\r\nI have watched every single Chris Nolan\u2019s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn\u2019t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn\u2019t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. \r\n\r\nThe sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. \r\nI also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.\r\nThe casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. \r\n\r\nIf you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table.\r\n \r\nSome people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremely _boring._ Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.\r\n**Overall, this movie is a masterpiece**. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film. I want to thank the crew who have worked very hard on this project, I want to thank the actors who just showed a staggering performance, I want to thank Ludwig Goransson for his amazing soundtracks in this film, and of course, I want to thank Christopher Nolan for his dedication and his amazing film, I would like to call **his masterpiece**.",
            "Well, was a interesting movie. But, the scene of the nuclear bomb i felt a little disappointed. Even when the credits start to show up i said: \"Wait, really the so trend nuclear bomb scene was what i saw in Los Alamos?\r\n\r\nI imagined another bigger bomb and destructive!",
            "The movie is dramatic, thrilling and gives an insight of a true event that had happened in the past",
            "Yep, a quality film.\r\n\r\n<em>'Oppenheimer'</em> lived up to the billing to me. Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.\r\n\r\nEver since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's <em>'<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>, for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adjustment-bureau/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Adjustment Bureau</a>'</em>. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this, at least for me. It is not my favourite Nolan movie, <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/inception/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inception</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/interstellar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interstellar</a>'</em> surpass but to be honest it's the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard. For example, <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dunkirk-2017/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dunkirk</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tenet</a>'</em> move me less but are still ones I rate highly.\r\n\r\nFinal words on this: Watch it if you get the opportunity. One of the big 'uns!",
            "The problem with biographies is that you have to make sure not to put your own beliefs & present them as facts to white-wash a person/organization.\r\n\r\nOppenheimer was a brilliant scientist indeed but he was also a COMMUNIST (there is a ton of evidence/articles about it and he even admitted liking communist ideas and social values, was a member of communist fronts, subscriber to communist magazines, sent them money monthly, his brother, wife, mistress and believe it or not many of his students were also known communists).\r\n\r\nHe was indeed a security risk and some may go further to say that he committed an act of treason but the film presented a false image of Oppenheimer as the \"mistreated scientist\" who had to endure great injustice for the higher cause of stopping a nuclear arms race.",
            "Movie is extremely slow and boring. I'm not fan of Nolan's movies, but still decided to watch it since this movie won an Oscar and has lots of famous actors inside. I thought it would be good, but boy I was wrong!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there's this stupid annoying background music all the time during the movie, which is very distracting. Now add to this background music actors that talk almost like whispering. It's just horrible, but what's worst about this movie is that it is super boring and uninteresting and it's very long (3 hours). This movie is a total garbage, but since it's a Nolan's movie and has so many high profile actors it has big hype and high ratings, but don't be fooled. This is a pure trash. I regret I wasted 3 hours on this boredom.",
            "[MINOR SPOILERS, but nothing major]\r\nThis film was unlike any I have ever seen. Let me be clear, it is certainly not for everyone. The daunting 3-hour runtime can steer some away, which I completely understand, but you have the time and patience, give it a chance.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the film is consumed by dialogue, yet never once did I get bored. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time (it helped that I wasn\u2019t well-versed in the history of Robert Oppenheimer as a person, although I knew the gist of his story).   The non-linear plot format also helped to keep my attention as we see blips of Oppenheimer\u2019s life as a student, working on the Manhattan Project, and the scrutiny he faced afterward. This take on the presentation of his story could\u2019ve easily backfired and been executed poorly. However, director Christopher Nolan constructed it in a way that was both interesting and easy to follow.\r\n\r\nCillian Murphy delivered a convincing portrayal and Oppenheimer\u2019s emotional journey is shown beautifully through his performance. Robert Downey Jr. does just as good of a job, as he portrays Lewis Strauss as he grapples with his complicated relationship with Oppenheimer. Acting-wise, Murphy and Downey were the highlights, but Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh all played their parts well. \r\n\r\nActing aside, the music score further enhanced my viewing experience. As a musician, music is something I always pay attention to in films. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson brilliantly composed a soundtrack to represent that whirlwind of thoughts and emotions conveyed by Oppenheimer\u2019s life. I had already been exposed to some of his work prior to this, so when I saw he was composing for this movie, it piqued my interest. _Can You Hear the Music_ was not only one of my favorite parts of the music, but of the film as a whole. The chaotic, yet beautiful string runs that gradually increase in speed along with the subtle yet alarming horns in the background give off a complicated feeling of dread, anxiety, and contemplation.\r\n\r\nI saw this for the first time in theaters, a second time at home, and then again in theaters a couple months ago in March when it was briefly reissued.\r\n\r\nAlthough you may not like it as much as me (this review is definitely a bit biased), I strongly urge you to give it a watch.",

            "I'd completely forgotten about \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that \"Mike\" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - \"Armando\" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner \"Marcus\" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",
            "For a fourth outing, <em>'Bad Boys: Ride or Die'</em> still finds a way to produce the goods.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed what I watched. The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",
            "I didn\u2019t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn\u2019t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film\u2019s core strengths\u2014its characters and story\u2014remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you\u2019ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",
            "We liked Bad Boys because it was Lethal Weapon in Miami, and we like Lethal Weapon because it was just like the other 356 buddy cop movies we saw before it.  It's a timeless LCD flick that you're going to go and see because you know it delivers....\r\n\r\n... the thing is, it didn't.  This one took itself a bit too seriously.  It had to, the actors are a bit too old to be on the money like with were in the first two...\r\n\r\n... well Martin is, Will I think can still pull off the action bit.  He's clearly still in good shape.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of the comedy is absent, a lot of the bickering is gone, and we like buddy cop movies because we like the humor and we like seeing two hard men bickering like an old married couple...\r\n\r\n... because men who have known one another forever tend to bicker like that and it's always fun to watch and listen to even when it's not in an action movie setting.\r\n\r\nAnd frankly, they lost sight of that too.\r\n\r\nSo what is left is a buddy cop movie that forgot a lot of the tropes of the buddy cop movies... and that just doesn't work.  We watched Bad Boys because it was Lethal Weapon, and we watched Lethal Weapon because we liked the other 789 buddy cop flicks we saw before it.\r\n\r\nBut... again, it's 2024, our expectations are so low that we will let this slide and think it's great because, honestly, modern movies suck and this one didn't suck as hard.\r\n\r\nSo back to 1995 when they remade Lethal Weapon and brought in elements from Miami Vice and... yeah, the movie still wasn't great, but it was really fun and entertaining and that is what counted.",
            "Not awful but hardly remarkable either, Bad Boys, Ride or Die is a passable shake and bake, crime action flick. \r\n\r\nThe downsides, in short order, include a rapper gangsta vibe, that's overcooked to the point of cultural cremation. Its no helped by humour, that's, for most of this film, rarely even remotely funny. \r\n\r\nThe upside is what you would expect, polished and unrelentingly, over the top action, which, taken on its own, is entertaining. Backed by a serviceable, if basic, story.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you can look past the gangster, rapper bombast, Bad Boys, Ride or Die, is an enjoyable, synapse neutral, action flick, for a slow day or evening.Worth a look.",
            "I had an absolute blast watching \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life,\u201d pay homage to the \u201cBad Boys\u201d legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\r\n\r\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn\u2019t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It\u2019s a rare combination in what could\u2019ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there\u2019s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\r\n\r\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah\u2019s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that\u2019s best experienced with an audience that\u2019s also fired up to be there.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved everything about \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die.\u201d It\u2019s the type of action film that\u2019s done so well, you\u2019ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",
            "Good job, Bad Boys. You're gonna make a satisfying film when I come for you. \r\n\r\nI kind of ignored the first hour and a half but definitely the first hour. It might be for the best but Lawrence is good. Will is good. But they're also bad.\r\n\r\nI like the spiritual overtones and comedy. Satisfying buddy comedy. The drones are sweet. I liked the AI camera effects. The psycho killer younger guys are good. Insane violence at the end. Seemed so PG until you hit the violence and there is so much celebration of violence. Maybe I missed some previous violence but it seemed quite intense and sudden.\r\n\r\nI hope they make a sequel with the psychos. Grandpas can Denzel some guys. Hopefully they'll match their speech with the rest of the graphic content. All the humour is so tame. I hear you get to say more shit when you get old. BBCU4L",
            "I will not deny that I found this movie somewhat entertaining. Maybe even fairly entertaining.\r\n\r\nThis mostly comes from the action and a few entertaining humorous scenes splattered across the movie.\r\n\r\nHowever, it could have been so much better if the script had not been written by the usual bunch of low IQ Hollywood hacks.\r\n\r\nMost of the humor is just unintelligent and cringeworthy. Marcus Burnett is simply nonsensically silly most of the time. His feeding nonsense followed by this ridiculous \u201cI am immortal\u201d crap and rubbish dream scenes were not funny at all but rather dragged down the movie.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to create drama by making Lowrey have psychotic episodes which ruined the mission and action on several occasions was also totally unnecessary in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy started off really good with the first scenes where the entire plot is set up. Then however, he just became your average Hollywood villain. The initial badass bad guy vibe was never developed.\r\n\r\nThe script itself is a classical Hollywood action script. That is, it is simple, very predictable, unrealistic with lots of plot holes and really just a rehash of something done a million times.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this context, it was not bad. It was certainly good enough for this type of movie.\r\n\r\nThis could have been a really good movie if the task of coming up with a script had just been given to someone with some actual talent.\r\n\r\nAs it stands this is just a somewhat (maybe even fairly) entertaining Hollywood action movie."

            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/smile-2-review/\r\n\r\n\"Smile 2 not only proves to be the best horror movie of 2024, but it also stands out as one of the best horror sequels in recent years, improving upon all aspects that made the original a gigantic success. Through a thought-provoking exploration of trauma, loss, and guilt, the story\u2019s rising emotional intensity elevates the fascinating horror elements, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience.\r\n\r\nNaomi Scott\u2019s career-best, riveting performance combines with technical qualities worthy of awards-season recognition, solidifying Parker Finn\u2019s name as one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary horror.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",
            "An improvement on the (good) original.\r\n\r\nNaomi Scott's performance is outstanding, she is so convincing and fully committed to the role all the way through - to the point that she elevates the film as a whole up a notch. The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.\r\n\r\nThe run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things. Much of what is onscreen helps nullify any potential (minor) pacing issues, the violence and gore is quite graphic but it is nicely done and is exactly what we want to see from a production of this sort, let's be real.\r\n\r\nI will say this does feature a few too many cheap jump scares, something I'm not a big fan of, but just like the above it isn't a notion that hinders the overall quality of the end result. Based on the ending, the next sequel could be a lot of fun - here's hoping!",
            "Tween horror.  Perfect to have on in the background whilst making tiktoks or like somthing I dunno lol.\r\nI get the feeling the script for this was written in text speak and emojis.  I'm not sure if this is Blumhouse, I couldn't summon enough interest to bother finding out.\r\n\r\nIf you've seen the first flick (not movie and certainly not film), you know what this is about, cheese \"jump scares\" that solely rely on the sound being loud and some tween-palette friendly \"gore\" - a bit of blood.  Nothing's shocking, horrifying or engaging and the \"acting\" is terrible, which is maybe the most shocking element.\r\n\r\nThat guy that was in The White Lotus, I've seen be good in things other than this, he's not good in the 5 minutes or so he's in this.\r\nNaomi Scott waddles round like a less obese version of Florence Pugh with even less charisma.  She's pretending to be a pop star, a story misstep that leads to some AI generated music that somehow sounds a decade or so dated.\r\n\r\nFilm could have been vastly improved if it was ~80 minutes of Scott being attack with a screwdriver, but that didn't happen and it's 2hours of mediocrity.  Looking at the sidebar here, it made money, so I guess we're getting Smile 3.  With some luck, that will be an entirely AI project and no actual creatives will be harmed in the creation process.",
            "The only thing I can remember about the first Smile (2022) was that it went downhill after that opening scene with the patient.\r\n\r\nI had no intention of watching a second one until I saw it was Naomi Scott, \"... fine.\" Now I'm looking forward to the next one.\r\n\r\nNaomi Scott carried this film with her performance.",
            "First Smile was a great horror movie. I was worried that second one wouldn't be very good as usually this is how it happens, but thankfully, Smile 2 was a great continuation of first one. It didn't disappoint. I'm very pleased with Smile 2. They did great.",
            "I found it to be a significant improvement over the first installment. Naomi Scott's portrayal of Skye Riley is outstanding; she brings depth and authenticity to every emotional scene, making her character's journey compelling and relatable.\r\n\r\nThe film benefits from a higher budget of $28 million, compared to the original's $17 million, which is evident in its enhanced production quality. The opening prologue is particularly gripping, setting a tense and immersive tone right from the start.\r\n\r\nDirector Parker Finn adopts a more mainstream approach with effective jump scares and incorporates intense gore scenes that heighten the horror experience. The narrative cleverly blurs the lines between reality and illusion, keeping viewers on edge and questioning what's real.\r\n\r\nOverall, *Smile 2* delivers a thrilling and psychologically engaging horror experience, surpassing its predecessor in both storytelling and production.",
            "\"_Fuck the tour!_\"\r\n\r\nNaomi Scott... I did not regonize your game. You acted your tushy off in this! The first Smile was a nice refreshing horror movie and this sequel does not disappoint. Hard to not to mention parts that would be spoilers, but there are some twists that made me want to watch this again just to make sure I didn't miss any details."

            "<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.\r\n\r\nOf the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\r\n\r\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\r\n\r\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",
            "I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. \"Rain\" (Cailee Spaeny) and her \"brother\" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",
            "Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. \r\n\r\nWhats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. \r\n\r\nIf you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.\r\n\r\nThe results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? \r\n\r\nIn summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an \"okay\" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",
            "Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by \u201cAlien: Romulus,\u201d a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the roots of the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn\u2019t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn\u2019t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise\u2019s good will, it actually has some substance.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film\u2019s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There\u2019s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past \u201cAlien\u201d films.\r\n\r\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don\u2019t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that\u2019s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny\u2019s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\r\n\r\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it\u2019s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",
            "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/alien-romulus-review-an-audiovisual-triumph-held-back-by-reverence-to-the-past/\r\n\r\n\"Alien: Romulus is an impressive technical spectacle that highlights Fede \u00c1lvarez's talent in creating an atmosphere of tension and horror, raising the audiovisual standard of the saga to new heights through immersive sound design and Galo Olivares' stunning cinematography, which deserves countless accolades.\r\n\r\nHowever, its excessive reliance on references to the past prevents it from reaching its full narrative potential, as well as achieving a thematic impact similar to the franchise's best installments.\r\n\r\nDespite this, the captivating performances of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, along with a third act filled with insane entertainment, make this interquel a cinematic experience worth seeing in IMAX, even if it leaves the feeling that it could have been more daring and innovative.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",
            "Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.\r\n\r\nThis movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score \u2013 it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious \u00c1lvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.\r\n\r\nThe cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.\r\n\r\nOne thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action \u2013 this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede \u00c1lvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.\r\n\r\nI was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. \u00c1lvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.\r\n\r\nI'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.\r\n\r\nAlien: Romulus is a worthy successor to the Alien throne. It's a visual treat, a thrilling ride, and a damn good reminder of why we love this franchise in the first place.",
            "This was a great movie and a great continuation of Alien series. I think it deserves solid, perfect 10/10. I couldn't see any flow, everything was great.",
            "This is a great B-movie for people looking for a bit of a thrill.",
            "**Maybe the best \"Alien\" movie after \"Aliens\", but at least as good as Prometheus (but in a different way)**\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this movie a lot. It didn't try to be edgy or special - it seems to be directed by a guy who loved the first 2 Alien movies from the 80ies and wanted to add a movie as best as he could do in our time which is still faithful to those 2 original movies and could be considered a worthy addition to the original \"Alien\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android \"brother\", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.\r\n\r\nAnother main thing to mention are the effects and set desing. A lot of great practical effects, lighting and cinematography and the set design which is faithful to that of the first 2 Alien movies make this movie a great enjoyment for anyone who like the.\r\n\r\nSo, if you love the first 2 Alien movies - this movie is for you!",
            "\"Alien: Romulus\" is a visually admirable film, but it really has nothing new to show us and even worse than that it has nothing fresh to say. It is merely content to plunder inspiration from the preceding films and the only entry in the series which appears to be left unplundered is \"Alien 3\" (1992), but then this omission can hardly be described as surprising. After all, it isn't held in particularly high regard by the legions of loyal fans who absolutely adore these films for their often groundbreaking achievements and idolise the inexhaustible resourcefulness of Ellen Ripley. Unfortunately, these same loyal fans aren't going to find anything worth adoring or idolising in this latest effort. It is still a reasonably entertaining motion picture, but only because you can spend most of the running time attempting to guess which scene comes from which film in order to appease your overwhelming sense of disappointment with it all.",
            "The Alien franchise has had its ups and downs with mostly the latter in recent years. This latest one, which takes place in between Alien: Covenant and Alien in the timeline, is a solid entry from Fede Alvarez and is more in the vein of the first film in terms of look and tone. The story is pretty basic and no real twists that we haven't seen before in the franchise, but I did like the lead actress Cailee Spaeny. The classic line, \"Getaway from her you bitch\" was delivered as great as Bale's \"I'll be back\" from Terminator Salvation (meaning not very well). Still, an all around entertaining sci-fi horror film that has great effects, both practical and CGI. **3.5/5**",
            "Fede \u00c1lvarez delivers a film in Alien: Romulus that tries to revitalize the franchise but stumbles on several key aspects. While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.\r\n\r\nThe script relies too heavily on genre clich\u00e9s, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists. Attempts to explore philosophical themes about survival and human nature remain superficial, leaving the impression that the film tries to tackle more than it can handle.\r\n\r\n\u00c1lvarez\u2019s direction, which has shone in the past with more intimate horror projects, feels overwhelmed in such an established universe. The moments of tension and terror fail to achieve the desired impact, falling into an uneven rhythm that alternates between dull and predictable.\r\n\r\nFor the most devoted fans of Alien, this installment is particularly disappointing. In an unfortunate parallel to Disney's mishandling of the Star Wars saga, Romulus feels like a production that prioritizes franchise formulas over true innovation or respect for the original spirit. Rather than expanding the Alien legacy, the film dilutes it, leaving a bitter aftertaste for fans who had expected much more.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Alien: Romulus fails to live up to its heritage, becoming a missed opportunity and a reminder that not all cinematic revivals are necessary."

Downey Jr. comes across largely central, it is still a good mix and IMHO the best scenes in the movie involve the generated Hulk character.\r\n\r\nWith that kind of successful melding of characters, Hollywood-scale egos and even computer generated characters; you have to give it up to the writers and director to make this the successful film that it is.",
            "**A long format review from 2012**\r\n\r\nMy new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;\r\n\r\n1. The Avengers\r\n2. Iron Man\r\n3. Thor\r\n4. Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it\u2019s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us\u2026 So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau\u2019s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor\u2019s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn\u2019t a Thor movie, so we don\u2019t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year\u2019s Thor 2, it is very possible we\u2019ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki\u2019s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won\u2019t spoil it by telling you who they\u2019re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn\u2019t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn\u2019t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn\u2019t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!\r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",
            "After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some \u201cdepth\u201d to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always liked Robert Downey Jr\u2019s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he\u2019s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the \u201cpuny god\u201d scene (if you haven\u2019t seen the film yet you\u2019ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I\u2019m Scandinavian so\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much.",
            "One of the few movies to actually make me feel like a kid again, Joss Whedon was the perfect filmmaker to do this film. Everyone gets their time to shine. The script juggles every plot point and character moment with clarity and ease. It's funny, smart, and visually jaw dropping. Definitely lived up to the five movie hype.",
            "I give this 10 Stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be, but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the Marvel Cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. Having Joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. This movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that.",
            "Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.\r\n\r\nAsgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.\r\n\r\nI have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.\r\n\r\nFlaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",

The whole banding together with the death of Agent Coulson still doesn't feel right, good character but didn't think he was so beloved to be a catalyst for them. Minor point just something that stood out then, and now. Also a bit hollow given, IIRC, was alive and well for the Agents of SHIELD TV series... **4.25/5**",
            "The last hour is a lot of fun, but I found the opening chunk disappointing.\r\n\r\nI was expecting wall-to-wall action, pretty much from the start - especially given the forces that join together. However, I felt the first half of <em>'The Avengers'</em> as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed.\r\n\r\nThe last half is much better, which allowed me to enjoy myself properly. Robert Downey Jr., while not as entertaining as he is on his own, brings goodness, as do the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of recasts, though Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is a positive one; even if that took a bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining, given we hadn't seen Ruffalo himself before. Added to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, at least in terms of the film franchise, getting major screen time out of nowhere - having been a bit part character in her debut MCU appearance.\r\n\r\nThe music is noteworthy, while everything looks brilliant. Overall and in short: It's a fun, good action film - I just expected greater.",
            "I have to say that the furore surrounding this film had pretty much doomed it to failure in my book. The Marvel marketing machine had gone into over-drive plugging it, so no way could it be any good. Well, it is good. Not great, but it is good. The compendium element of the storyline pits all of the superheroes against the mischievous \"Loki\" (a cute, curly haired, Tom Hiddleston) whom, together with his army of extraterrestrial henchmen, is bent on taking over the world... well, of course he is... The writing is nothing special at all, but who cares? The visual effects are great and each of the characters gets their moment in the sun as they work to thwart our Tom's even plotting. Robert Downey Jr. Steals the show as engineering genius \"Tony Stark\" with Scareltt Johansson and Chris Hemsworth - and his trusty hammer - on great form too. I'm afraid I find the whole \"Capt. America\" character so nauseatingly wholesome that even Chris Evans in his spray-on lycra cannot do anything other than put me firmly in the baddies camp right from the get-go. On the downside, Mark Ruffalo tries hard with the rather limited opportunities offered him as the rather dull \"Hulk\", and Clark Gregg continues to prove he must be one of the luckiest actors alive to have alighted on this franchise - he is hopelessly wooden as \"Coulson\" but as a piece of fast-paced fantasy entertainment this film takes some beating (\"Star Wars\" notwithstanding). It is too long - the fight/chase scenes can get a tad recycled and repetitive after a while but it all builds well to a fitting crescendo that did make me wonder whether the impeding alien invasion may have ended up causing less damage than the saviours of mankind did! No point watching if you're not up for a complete suspension of reality - this is a top class adventure with loads of quirky characters, a bit of humour, plenty of fisticuffs and even a bit of Schubert!! Great stuff!"

            "And so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine",
            "Too much CGI, redundancy, clich\u00e9s and drawn out \u201clooks of love\u201d for my tastes.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        \r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I\u2019ve never read Tokien, likely because I\u2019m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien\u2019s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (1982) and \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u201d (1991) with \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d (1939) sounds good, then you\u2019ll probably like these movies more than me. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Return of the King\u201d is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It\u2019s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could\u2019ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   \r\n\r\nLike the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there\u2019s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with \u201cThe Two Towers,\u201d there\u2019s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you\u2019ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they\u2019re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. \r\n\r\nThen there are WAY too many \u201clooks of love\u201d between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There\u2019s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one\u2019s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling clich\u00e9?    \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There\u2019s Miranda Otto as \u00c9owyn, Th\u00e9oden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit\u2019s wife. \u201cMythica: A Quest for Heroes\u201d (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d and \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God\u201d (2005). It\u2019s not rocket science. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the movie\u2019s needlessly overlong and things could\u2019ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and \u201clooks of love\u201d are tacked on. \r\n\r\nDespite these honest quibbles, \u201cThe Return of the King,\u201d and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C",
            "Great finale to a great trilogy. The action and battle sequences were amazing and even though I've seen this a few times over the years, still thrilling to the end. I didn't even mind the multiple endings as I had in the past, nice each character got their due. **4.75/5**",
            "An outstanding end to the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI expected a lot from <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'</em> so I am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\r\n\r\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\r\n\r\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\r\n\r\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing <em>'The Hobbit'</em> films.",
            "As an avid fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings from long before New Line announced this movie \"trilogy,\" I must say all three films were fairly large disappointments.  Now, mind you, I am not your usual, \"The book is better\" movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That's just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen's stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom's third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books.\r\n\r\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What's most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien's triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose I'll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my lifetime).  In the meantime, I'll continue to read the books every year.",
            "A fitting end to a classic trilogy.\r\nFrodo, Samwise, and Gollum journey through a Hell on what is called \"Middle Earth\", while Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas go to war. King Theoden must decide whether to help those who would not help him. Merry wants to war, but is too small. Pippin finds himself getting in more and more mischief.\r\nLots of subplots. Never a dull second. Masterfully dierected.\r\nWhat more can be said? Truly mesmerizing every step of the way, and a movie with maybe four endings that just lead into each other, and we still can't get enough.",
            "I've just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London's sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it's magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of \"Frodo\", \"Sam\" and their treacherous guide \"Gollum\" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of \"Sauron\" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn \"Eowyn\" (Miranda Otto); the delusional \"Denethor\" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish \"Faramir\" (David Wenham) as \"Gondor\" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between \"Gimli\" & \"Legolas\" features all too sparingly and it's got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting \"Into the West\" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever."

            "I did quite enjoy this, but it's far too long and I found that the funniest bits had all already been seen in the trails! Initially, it centres around the fairly tempestuous relationship between models \"Carl\" (Harris Dickinson) and \"Yaya\" (Charlbi Dean). The latter is an influencer who looks at their relationship as something more transient; he is much more besotted - and so vows to make her fall in enduring love with him. Off onto a luxury yacht they head for an holiday with a few millionaires run by the super-officious \"Paula\" (Vicki Berlin) and captained by the dipsomaniac Woody Harrelson. The two befriend the lively and charismatic Russian oligarch \"Dimitry\" (Zlatlo Buric) and his wife \"Vera\" (Sunnyi Melles) before a captain's dinner that the choppy seas ensure ends in a messy and entertaining disaster! The remainder of their adventure has something of the \"Admirable Crichton\" to it, as they must adapt to the command of their erstwhile toilet cleaner \"Abigail\" (Dolly De Leon) who exacts her own unique sort of fees from her erstwhile patrons in return for catching fish and lighting fires... It does take a ping at the vacuousness of the modelling industry and at the unscrupulousness of big business - best exemplified in one scene with Oliver Ford Davies and Amanda Walker as the demure Brits who made their fortune selling \"the greatest single contribution to democracy\" (hand grenades!). Sadly, though, the moments of humour are relatively short and sweet when put into the context of this lengthy and frequently rather dull enterprise. Dickinson looks great shirtless, but as an actor he has limitations and I didn't really feel much chemistry between him and, well, anyone else. The last half hour could have been better, funnier, had there been a slight sense of menace - but somehow I just knew that the ending was going to deliver they way it does. Buric adds value, as does Henrik Dorsin's gazillionaire \"Jarmo\" but by half way through the joke had worn too thin to sustain it and I was a little bored. Doesn't need a big screen, and co-produced by the BBC I expect it can wait for Christmas television for most of us.",
            "sketched, never completed\r\n\r\nLooks like the director/writer had some notes, and didn't get around to write a complete script. So the movie starts out very promising, but then gradually runs out of ideas, until the last half is just ticking off the boxes of expected items.\r\n\r\nThe quirky, funny look into modelling is followed by a well cast and (in some moments) acted part about relationship issues between inexperienced, clueless, and selfish people. \r\nWe learn that the na\u00efve male model is actually in love, while his female model/influencer counterpart tells him he's nice entertainment until she finds a rich guy to be trophy wife for. This doesn't deter him... and that was the promising bit. \r\n\r\nNext, they are on a luxury yacht for the decadents; and there is still potential for a really good story: the upstairs/downstairs angle is only implemented in a few scenes, most screen time of this part is spent on lavish dining with icky \"haute cuisine\" food in rough seas, and the consequences thereof.\r\n\r\nThat was when the really good part could've started: how to they meet or avoid gazes the next day, the day after? What has changed, how, what shouldn't and how do class barriers break?\r\n\r\nInstead, we get a clownish intermezzo and next, the boring island section. This part is just tedious agitprop, reducing the (already shallow) characters to templates, and doing all the expected bits. Waste of time, talent, and a nice beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason, people are so content with half-baked products these days, you can even win prizes this way. 5/10, there's better ways to waste time, but this isn't the worst either.",

            "A social media and extremely influential power couple, Carl ( Harris Dickinson ) and Yaya ( Charlbi Dean Kriek ) are invited on board a private luxury super boat in a bid to promote the experience to their followers. The boat has a number of mega rich but morally bankrupt passengers and a large team of staff to pamper to their every whim. \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d develops characterisation as the audience get to know the guests, their status and their wealth.

It is this particular evening, a rough night on the sea, \u00a0that events take a sinister turn with most passengers violently ill due to the effects of sea sickness.

            "**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**\r\n\r\n\r\nWriter / director Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2018s wickedly sharp black comedy \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d offers a biting satire of everything from gender roles, capitalist society, corruption of power, modern masculinity, and the social hierarchies that result from a system that encourages class division. The film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.\r\n\r\nThe film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however. It\u2019s an in-your-face story that doesn\u2019t shy away from confronting everything from the rampant abuse of the less privileged to the primitive savagery of human nature.\r\n\r\nInstagram influencers and celebrity model couple Carl (Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean) are invited on an all-expenses-paid vacation on a luxury cruise in exchange for expert promotion on social media. The ritzy yacht is frequented by ultra-rich passengers who demand the finest things in life (one of the early scenes features a helicopter air-dropping a couple of jars of Nutella in the ocean, which is hilarious because it\u2019s so ridiculous).\r\n\r\nAs Carl and Yaya settle in, they begin to meet their very wealthy fellow guests, including a couple of British arms dealers, a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric), and an unhinged Marxist boat captain (Woody Harrelson) who spends the majority of the cruise drunk and locked in his cabin. If not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. But after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today\u2019s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.\r\n\r\nWhile it would\u2019ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, \u00d6stlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable. They\u2019re not entirely jackasses, they\u2019re just mega-wealthy. Setting the film on a cruise ship is brilliant too, as they have a built-in class system between passengers and amongst the crew. The boat symbolizes the hierarchy of social classes, including the officers, the predominantly white \u201cface time\u201d staff, and the lower rungs that include the cooks, engineers, janitorial workers, and other people of color. It\u2019s satisfying to watch the pecking order not only completely dissolve but get turned upside down after the yacht sinks. That\u2019s when the working class takes over, because they\u2019re the ones who know how to get stuff done.\r\n\r\nThe film offers shrewd observations and a critique of class and privilege, culminating in a third act that delivers a bountiful amount of schadenfreude. The best is the story of \u201ctoilet worker\u201d Abigal (Dolly De Leon, who gives the film\u2019s standout performance), a woman who quickly takes command on the deserted island because she is the only person with any sort of survival skills. After starting a fire, catching fish, and handling the distribution of the small amount of supplies left on the lifeboat, she demands that everyone refer to her as \u201cCaptain.\u201d She even begins trading food for sexual favors with Carl.\r\n\r\n\u00d6stlund\u2019s film about a cruise from hell is an achievement in satire that effortlessly skewers many timely subjects. He sets his eyes squarely on deserved targets and dismantles them with wit and sophistication, making \u201cTriangle of Sadness\u201d one of the smartest and most interesting films of the year.",

Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.\r\n\r\nMaybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine.

            "**A good Western, despite its weaknesses.**\r\n\r\nMany decades ago, Italian Western films were a huge success and guaranteed the careers of several actors, such as Clint Eastwood, and directors like Sergio Leone. This film, however, is neither Italian nor American: despite being spoken in English and featuring North American actors, it is a film directed by the Dutch (Martin Koolhoven and his team), shot in Spain and where Hungarians and Austrians also collaborated. Out of this Babel of nationalities, however, emerged a good Western film.\r\n\r\nThe plot is the strongest point of this film, which wonderfully works the epic style and a tension that grows, chapter by chapter (was I the only one to see in this chapter organization and non-linear narrative some influence by Tarantino?). I won't reveal too much about the plot, but I think I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment if I say that everything revolves around a young woman who tries to escape from a crazed Protestant pastor who is determined to kill her, no matter the place or the circumstances. The film builds an absolutely detestable and maniacal villain, and gives the female character the gifts and strength to defeat him, and to captivate us with sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe film is not perfect, there are logic flaws, continuity flaws and absurd situations. But the film nevertheless entertains the audience very well. Guy Pearce stands out the most, giving life to a captivating and execrable villain. The actor is excellent and gives us the best work of his career so far. Dakota Fanning holds the central female character and handles the task at hand well, but I felt several times that she doesn't have a challenging task. Kit Harrington can complain even more, since he saw his character killed early and didn't have time to show talent, despite the film being almost two and a half hours long.\r\n\r\nRegarding the length, I am of the opinion that it would have been better with about thirty minutes less, and that this denotes a certain sloppiness in the editing and in the selection of the scenes that should have been in the final cut. The film is impactful, it is quite violent, realistic and not suitable for teenagers, impressionable people and animal lovers (as far as I know, no one was hurt in the filming, but there are several intense scenes that include animals). The sets and costumes were very well-designed, despite the fact that the film works in a certain temporal limbo in which it is very difficult to have a sense of the time in which everything happens (somewhere between 1880 and 1910?). The scenarios are also very good, and the soundtrack was very well conceived.",
            "Yeah, another Western, had to wait for the wife to not be home so I could dive into a genre she hates.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's odd how sex and nudity seem out of place in westerns given that in real life prostitution thrived. Historically a lot of what this film is about could be true. But... it doesn't feel like it should be in a Western. Racism and violence, yeah, those can make it in and feel right. Prostitution, certainly... but in a not seen sort of way.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know, it's a lot of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart with Clint Eastwood bringing up the rear that sort of defines the genre for people my age.\r\n\r\nThat being said... it's dark.\r\n\r\nBut it's done right, and it's well acted, and it plays on the emotions something fierce, it's well acted, it's moody. In other words it's an insanely well done movie, despite that fact that it deals with subject matter that you don't expect coming into a western.\r\n\r\nInsanely well done."

            "**_An impressive eco-thriller that could do with more clearly delineated characters_**\r\n\r\n>_It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life._\r\n\r\n- Rachel Carson; _The Sea Around Us_ (1951)\r\n\r\n>_From the ocean came a roar of passions that seemed to have broken through all barriers: 'We must procreate and multiply! We must exhaust all the powers of lust!' The waves glowed like lava, and I imagined I could see multitudes of living beings \u2013 algae, whales, sea monsters \u2013 revelling in an orgy, from the surface to_ _the bottom of the sea. Immortality was the law here._\r\n\r\n- Isaac Bashevis Singer; \"Hanka\"; from _Passions and Other Stories_ (1975)\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from writer/director Neasa Hardiman, _Sea Fever_ examines such issues as humanity's disregard for the size of our ecological footprint, the knee-jerk argument that if something hitherto unknown can't be exploited for profit then it should be destroyed, and Mankind's utter insignificance in the face of the wonders of nature. Heavily influenced by David Cronenberg's body horror films, Ridley Scott's _Alien_ (1979), and John Carpenter's _The Thing_ (1982), it could do with some refinement, especially in terms of characterisation, and the _d\u00e9nouement_ is a little anticlimactic, but Hardiman gets the atmosphere spot on, and overall, this is an impressive debut.\r\n\r\nSiobh\u00e1n (Hermione Corfield with a gorgeous head of red hair and a decent Irish accent) is an all-work-and-no-play doctoral student studying marine biology, specifically anomalous ecological patterns. A socially awkward introvert, she's not at all happy with she's told that she needs to get practical experience outside the lab and so her professor has organised for her to join a fishing boat and monitor their haul. The boat in question, the _Niamh Chinn-\u00d3ir_, is owned by Freya (Connie Nielsen) and captained by her husband Gerard (Dougray Scott), but it hasn't been doing too well recently and money is tight. However, Gerard has been tracking a huge shoal of fish and believes their luck is about to change. Meanwhile, Siobh\u00e1n gets to know the crew; Ciara (the always spectacular Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9), her son Johnny (Jack Hickey), genius engineer Omid (Ardalan Esmaili), and the baby of the group, Sudi (Elie Bouakaze). Upon sailing, Gerard sees that the shoal has moved into an exclusion zone, but without telling anyone, he too enters the zone. No sooner has he done so when the _Niamh_ hits something and becomes entangled. Investigating the collision, Siobh\u00e1n is stunned to see huge bioluminescent tentacles arising from the deep and attached to the hull. Back on board, she's thrilled to announce they may have encountered a creature unknown to science, but when it becomes apparent that the tentacles are secreting dangerous microscopic parasites onto the _Niamh_, the crew find themselves in a fight for survival, where their greatest enemy is one another.\r\n\r\nIn the _Fhianna\u00edocht_ [Fenian Cycle] of Irish mythology, Niamh Chinn \u00d3ir [Niamh of the Golden Hair] is the daughter of Manann\u00e1n mac Lir, king of the Otherworld, T\u00edr na n\u00d3g [Land of the Young]. Upon falling in love with Ois\u00edn, son of Fionn mac Cumhaill, Niamh returns with him to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, where they spend three happy years, although in the real world, 300 years have passed. Wanting to see his homeland again, Ois\u00edn persuades Niamh to let him return to Ireland. She gives him her horse, \u00c9nbarr, but warns him not to dismount and touch the soil or the spell of youth from T\u00edr na n\u00d3g will be broken. After finding his childhood home on _Cnoc Al\u00faine_ desolate, he is helping some men move a large stone when he falls from \u00c9nbarr and immediately turns into an old man. Before he dies, Ois\u00edn encounters Saint P\u00e1draig, telling him the stories of the _fianna_. The relevance for _Sea Fever_ is fairly obvious; the exclusion zone is T\u00edr na n\u00d3g and the _Niamh_ is Ois\u00edn, going somewhere it shouldn't be, a place which will fundamentally change it. The possibility of the Niamh returning to Ireland carrying an infection correlates with Ois\u00edn being 'infected' with age if he touches the soil of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn a post-screening Q&A with Hardiman at the film's Irish premi\u00e8re, she specifically said that one of the main impetuses behind the story was to offer a corrective for films which demonise or are critical of the scientific method, to challenge narratives which \"_depict the scientific method as being cut-off, antisocial, self-important, and irrelevant_\". In this sense, there's a lot more hard real-world science than you might expect \u2013 from details of Siobh\u00e1n's research and her explanations of marine biology, biodiversity, and anomalous patterns to some fairly detailed discussions of the possible biochemistry of the creature that ensnares the _Niamh_, hypotheses as to why it behaves the way it does, and detailed depictions of how the parasites enter and exit the bloodstream (how they exit is not for the faint at heart). In the latter half of the film, a lot of time is given over to discussions of whether the _Niamh_ should head back to Ireland, with Siobh\u00e1n trying to make the others understand the devastating ramifications that could result from introducing the parasites into a population centre. All of this doesn't quite position the film in the realm of science-fact, but it certainly helps to lend the narrative a stronger sense of real-world verisimilitude.\r\n\r\nScience is also important thematically insofar as one of the main issues explored is that the creature may not be acting aggressively in attaching to the _Niamh_; it's simply trying to survive, and even the parasites aren't a form of attack. In this way, Hardiman refuses to demonise the creature, and from the moment of its discovery, Siobh\u00e1n consistently argues that the crew must protect it, which is not what you expect from this type of film. On the other hand, Gerard sees it in more black and white terms; initially as something to be used for profit, and later as something to be destroyed \u2013 capitalism at its finest. There are no real villains as such, but on a sliding moral scale, the creature is above several of the human characters.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, there's a merciful absence of jump scares and, apart from one scene, there's very little gore. Instead, the film's horror elements are based more in the intricate sound design, Ray Ball's production design, and Ruair\u00ed O'Brien's cinematography. The three work in tandem to make it impossible for the viewer to ever forget that we're on a ship isolated at sea \u2013 from the constant creaking and sound of lapping water to the claustrophobic quarters (the _Niamh_ is so small, it only has four beds) to the handheld and often dimly lit photography that imbues every shadow with a sense of the unknown. Indeed, as was the _USCSS Nostromo_ in _Alien_ and U.S. Outpost 31 in _The Thing_, the rusty and battered _Niamh_ (a vessel which has clearly seen better days) is very much a character in _Sea Fever_, and its aesthetic design is pivotal in allowing Hardiman to achieve a sense of psychological unease.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, the most significant is that even given the small cast, there isn't a huge amount of character differentiation. Even Siobh\u00e1n is never really developed, whilst the _Niamh_'s crew are largely interchangeable. One of the reasons films like _Alien_ and _The Thing_ are considered classics is because of how good the character individualisation is \u2013 every person in both of those films is a distinct individual with an interiority and a clearly defined set of character traits that sets him or her apart from the others; pick any character, and you'll be able to talk about who that character is as a person, from the take-charge and rational Dallas (Tom Skerritt) to the reactionary Parker (Yaphet Kotto) in _Alien_, from the by-the-book and eerily calm Garry (Donald Moffat) to the hot-headed Childs (Keith David) in _The Thing_. Their traits aren't painted in minutiae, but they are painted in strokes clearly differentiated from the others. A failure to recreate this is one of the main reasons that Scott's _Prometheus_ (2012) is such a pile of tripe wherein no one is differentiated from anyone else and no one acts consistently because none of them have dominant character traits. _Sea Fever_'s script is a lot better than that rubbish, but it's still very light on individualisation, which makes it harder to care about these people, which makes them feel expendable, a potential death sentence for a film of this nature. Thankfully, it doesn't come to that here, but with just a little more work on the screenplay, the whole film could really have been elevated into something truly special. Another small gripe I have is that the conclusion is pretty anticlimactic; it works very well thematically, but it's a bit weak in terms of drama or tension, and it feels somewhat rushed.\r\n\r\nMixing body-horror with elements of a creature-feature garnished with some eco-friendly themes, _Sea Fever_ is a very enjoyable film and an impressive debut feature. Although its broader genre beats offer nothing we haven't seen before, it still manages to feel like its own thing with its own things to say. It could do with a better balance in terms of the plot/characterisation ratio, but the unexpected focus on science and ecological themes mean it rises above the monster movie clich\u00e9s you might expect, which should help it to stand out in a crowded field.",
            "It has a promising plot but somehow it lacked substance, especially towards the end of the film. Somehow I was expecting a conclusion to the entire \u201cmonster\u201d situation, but then it was left unattended.\r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching the film though. Would I watch it again? No. Would I make my friends watch it? Possibly.",
            "Ultimately, while it gets a boost of inadvertent timeliness from the COVID-19 climate of pandemic paranoia, face-touching phobia and quarantined cabin fever, 'Sea Fever' is a fairly straightforward, even generic, blue-collar-workers-in-peril thriller.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-sea-fever-paranoia-parasitic-plagues-and-pandemic-horror",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's the first thing I've watched recently that didn't feel like they could (and should) shave an hour off of it. A nice, light watch that had a unique concept and a likable cast. I agree with others that the eye popping scene was about as intense as it got, with everyone else dying in fairly lackluster ways. I'm not normally one to say up the gore, but a bit more would have made the second half feel more intense and urgent.\r\n\r\nI also couldn't help but find it amusingly relevant to the current world \"situation\" with Siobh\u00e1n urging everyone to quarantine themselves and think about the greater good over themselves. If she only knew what an impossible task that is.",
            "Obviously done on a shoestring budget, this is actually quite an interesting little sci-fi/horror mystery. It all centres around the crew of a stranded trawler who come to realise that there is a malevolent beastie that has found it's way into their water supply after their boat strayed into a restricted area. Luckily \"Siobh\u00e1n\" (Hermione Corfield) has some scientific skills and plans a way to stop this lethal parasite from killing (rather messily) not just the people on the boat, but anyone they come into contact to. Rather prudently, it does not try to blow us away with fancy special effects. The use of light on the water and some basic microbe imagery conjures enough just enough sense of menace to keep the plot interesting; as do the efforts from a confident Corfield alongside Dag Malmberg and Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 - and Jack Hickey is quite easy on the eye, too! The script is nobody's finest work, and it is a mite too long - but it delivers well enough within it's limitations and kills 90 minutes on the television fine."

            "I like this movie more than the one with Silvester Stallone. Nice slowmotion shots and a good story for an action movie.",
            "This film blow me away! I was not expecting this, a cop (a judge) based in the future with high violent's and great characters. You will think you will hate Dredd but you wont.",
            "I think this adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics books are a much more how most people probably would expect that a Judge Dredd movie should be, especially compared to the rather disappointing 1995 version. That of course means that the movie is quite violent. Anyone who has ever read the comics should not be surprised about the fact that this movie is mostly about taking out the bad guys, and if you cannot take out the bad guys using violence then just use more violence.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few gripes that I will come to I quite liked this movie. The plot is a fairly simple one but it is also a plot that I would not have been surprised to find in one of the 2000 AD comics. It is a quite suitable plot for a Judge Dredd movie. The plot centres around the drug \u201cSlo-Mo\u201d which slows down your perception of time. This of course gave the director carte blanche to use extreme slow motion effects which could have been quite annoying if overdone. I think it is used quite well in this movie though. I especially liked the effects on the people standing behind the door that Dredd blew in at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nJudge Dredd himself is well played by Karl Urban and, thankfully, he does not remove the helmet in this movie. I\u2019m sure it was done to satisfy Stallone\u2019s ego in the 1995 movie and it was one of the things that ruined it. Judge Dredd is not supposed to remove his helmet, period. \u201cMa-Ma\u201d is also a quite okay bad guy for this movie. Sufficiently psychopathic yet intelligent and rational enough to make a believable, at least as believable as a Judge Dredd villain can be, adversary to Dredd.\r\n\r\nI have a few gripes about the movie though. My main gripe is that it is not the ultra-modern city from the comics, at least from the comics that I have read since I have not read them all. It is more of a bunch of mega-scrapers spread out among the city slum that is left from today and still looks very non-futuristic. The initial chase scene is done using an old Volkswagen van for Christ sake. I really did not like that and, as far as I am concerned, it lost a star for that. If I remember the comics correctly MegaCity One was built more or less on top of the old ruins.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I did not like was the crooked judges. Ii is possible that they used the concept of a bad judge in some of the comics, I do not remember, but I still did not like it. The judges are supposed to be above \u201cordinary people\u201d. I am sure that they could have come up with some other plot element than that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the bottom line is that I quite enjoyed the movie. The fact that the DTS-HD Master Audio sound on my Blu-ray copy was excellent did add to the enjoyment of course. The surround and LFE effects was quite powerful yet balanced so they did not cause my somewhat weak subwoofer to go into resonance. Very enjoyable movie evening indeed.",
            "About a million years ago (1980-85ish), when I was a boy, I bought a comic each and every week called 2000AD. And I loved it. I mean, properly LOVED it. The flagship strip in this publication was (and all these years later, remains) Judge Dredd. The titular lead character (his name, a play on that of novelty UK ska/reggae artist Judge Dread - who himself lifted the moniker from a Prince Buster tune - although there any similarity ends, absolutely) was a \"Judge\", a one-tier law enforcement agent with the authority to arrest, charge, try and sentence perpetrators of crime on the spot (including issuing the death sentence, a sentence dealt out frequently), operating in the early 22nd century in Mega City One, a post-apocalyptic overpopulated dystopian conurbation stretching from Boston to Washington DC. A grim, violent piece, it nevertheless managed to mine some gallows humour from the ultra-right wing dispensing of justice, especially as doled out by our perpetually helmeted Dirty Harry-style anti-hero (of course, Harry Callaghan was constantly railing against the system. Not so Joe Dredd; he WAS the f*cking system).\r\n\r\nThere were many different colourful characters within the pages of 2000AD but Dredd was by far the favourite (generally speaking; My personal favourite was Strontium Dog, followed closely by Nemesis the Warlock and The A.B.C. Warriors) and was always the one most ripe for a possible movie adaptation somewhere down the line. And so it was that in 1994 promising British director Danny Cannon was attached to direct Judge Dredd - the next Sylvester Stallone movie. D'Oh! Anyway, the movie was released in 1995 and it was pretty-much a travesty, top-to-bottom. Cannon, it appeared, was simply hired to be Stallone's bitch, and despite the thing looking the part (the art department deserve some props for that film, you know) Stallone seemed determined to kick any in-place mythology straight in the bin if he didn't fancy it (Dredd never takes his helmet off, because the law is faceless, or something; Stallone takes his helmet off. Judges don't have relations with one another; Dredd develops a love interest with comic strip regular Judge Hershey. Thuggish recurring anti-hero Fergee is reduced to comic relief, major MAJOR Dredd arch-enemies The Angel Gang are reduced to one-scene throwaways and a robot looking A LOT like Hammerstein from The A.B.C. Warriors is introduced for no good reason whatsoever).\r\n\r\nAnd that, it seemed, was that. Nice one, Sly.\r\n\r\nUntil now. Finally, almost two decades of time and blockbuster, money-spinning superhero comic adaptations at the cinemas seems to have washed much of the foul stench of Sylvesters \"oeuf de poo-poo\" away, and for the final flush, here at last is the reboot: Dredd, starring Karl Urban (The Bourne Supremacy, Doom) and directed by Pete Travis (Vantage Point, Endgame) with a budget half that of its turkey-basted predecessor (more like a quarter when adjusting for inflation). So, what's it like? Well, if you're a fan of the source material you're going to have to throw out all of your notions of what Dredd and his Mega City environment should look like. Although neither nailed it aesthetically, the Cannon/Stallone movie looks the part more than this one. Until someone wants to commit Avatar-sized monies to the project, I don't know if anyone will ever truly nail it. No, this one is a rough and dirty thing, reminiscent of the sort of nasty, faceless sh*tholes you'll find in the Death Wish franchise of movies. Still, beauty's only skin-deep, they say, and what's important is that this movie captures the eighties vision of dystopian future in exactly the manner that Judge Dredd the comic strip did all those years ago. It \"feels\" like Judge Dredd, in a way that the Stallone movie never did, despite oh-so-many more bells and whistles.\r\n\r\nThe plot? The plot is simplicity itself. Dredd is assigned to accompany and evaluate new recruit Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a mutant who failed the Judge's aptitude test by a hair's breadth but who possesses a remarkable psychic ability to read peoples' minds, which the Justice Department obviously would want to exploit, IF Dredd decides that she can cut it as a Judge. Out they go to investigate a triple gangland-style execution in the Peach Trees city block, one of the thousands of futuristic high-rises that can hold 70,000 inhabitants, many of whom never have to leave the block in their entire lives. This particular block is ruled over by drug boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, 300), who ordered the executions. In an early exchange, Dredd & Anderson capture one of Ma-Ma's goons, and Anderson ascertains via her psychic skills that this particular goon was among those directly responsible for the executions. They decide to take him back to the Hall of Justice for questioning so's they can get the goods on head honcho Ma-Ma and her drug-traffiking industry but before they can do so, Ma-Ma seizes control of the security department of the block, locks the entire place down trapping the judges inside, and tells everybody inside to either help her kill the judges or get the f*ck out of her way; anyone helping the judges can expect to be killed too. So, Dredd and Anderson can either hide out until backup arrives, try to break out of the block somehow, or go up the building and after Ma-Ma, to kill her before she kills them. Which of those options do you suppose our man is going to go for?\r\n\r\nIn many ways, this film could've been called \"Anderson\" rather than \"Dredd\" (though obviously that wouldn't have been as marketable) since it's Anderson - played to just the right tone by Olivia Thirlby - who grows throughout this movie. And that's as it should be with Dredd: he DOESN'T change, he DOESN'T grow. He is a rock, a constant. Karl Urban - a childhood fan of Dredd himself - understands this and plays him to perfection (WITHOUT removing his helmet once; again, as it should be. Poxy Stallone). He's Robocop, without the warmth. For me though, the standout is Lena Headey. I wasn't enamoured at all with the idea of a \"new\" character as the main antagonist, and some whore-turned-druglord just smelled like that first \"market\" scene in Hannibal to me. But she's brilliant, really vicious. And the drug that Ma-Ma is pushing - Slo-Mo, which causes users to experience time at a tiny fraction of its real speed - allows us to view things through the eyes of the users, which in turn allows for some excellent slow-motion ballets of gruesome violence. And whilst the gore stays just-about on the cartoonish edge of things, this IS a very, VERY gruesome movie. About as gory as I've ever seen outside of the horror genre. But it moves at a real lick, it never lets up and it's all done and dusted inside the 90-minute mark. Lovely.\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, Dredd hasn't made its money back at the cinemas; a shame for a film that has had largely positive reviews and word-of-mouth. Still, it'll definitely go into the black when the DVD/blu-rays are released in the next couple of weeks, and that'll hopefully trigger a sequel or even the trilogy that writer Alex Garland wants to make. According to him, Dredd III - if it gets that far - will feature the Dark Judges. And that thought makes me quiver with excitement, like a boy reading his first copy of 2000AD, a million years ago.",
            "So, nothing new under the sun. The same boring story and characters mixed in another movie. The only thing remarkable in this movie is the slow motion used during the drug usage, which is not much to say.",
            "I really was quite a fan of Dredd, I thought the actors, post-staff, director, writers and cinematographer all did an outstanding job. However, there is one man in the crew who makes the rest look bad.\r\nBy comparison.\r\nBecause Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack is by leaps and bounds the standout piece of what was already a decent film by its own right. His work on Dredd is praise enough (he also did spectacular thing's for Limitless in 2011).\r\nI never got into the deeper Judge Dredd universe (ie. 2000 AD comics) and almost all of my knowledge comes from cursory internet searches, and that \"Dredd VS Death\" video game. But from what I can gather, Dredd is a more honest depiction of the source material than the Stallone-led Judge Dredd of '95.\r\nSo the music is outstanding, the Slow-Mo scenes are innovative and spectacularly produced and the specialised ammunition are astounding to watch. These are the three best parts of the film, in descending order, which to be fair, means that the gimmicks of Dredd are its most impressive feature. It's story is not broad (More of a \"day in the life\" than \"save the human race\" deal) and its characters are not greatly explored (though certainly not shallow), and it's mostly held together by these aforementioned \"gimmicks\", but more power to them! Better to have a solid baseline interconnected with deeply original fascination, than to have a boring rehashed piece of crap baseline, loosely stapled together with some poor excuse for dumping the same cliche $100,000 CGI explosions we've already seen four hundred times this quarter.\r\nSurprisingly, New Zealender Karl Urban (Star Trek, Star Trek: Into Darkness, LotR trilogy) makes for a better Dredd than I'd anticipated. Having a psychic was something I was initially sceptical of, too, however Olivia Thrilby (Juno, The Darkest Hour) put my concerns to rest after a long enough period to buy her role (about 25 minutes). And Lena Headey (Sarah Connor Chronicles, The Purge, Game of Thrones) I've liked since she played Queen Gorgo from 300 nearly a decade ago, so she\"s always a safe bet in my books, particularly in the role of relentless druglord Ma-Ma, she really is at home playing ruthless women of power, isn't she?\r\nThat all said, Dredd is not the best film I've ever seen. It's not even the best action-focused science-fiction film released in 2012 I've ever seen. But it takes risks, and that's nothing to be scoffed at. We need more Dredd's in our film industries, something to break up the monotony of most of Hollywood. Something that doesn't need to go big, or tick x amount of acceptability boxes, it's satisfied just being good.\r\n 77%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",
            "Incendiary!\r\n\r\nDredd is directed by Pete Travis and written by Alex Garland. It stars Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, Lena Headey and Wood Harris. Music is by Paul Leonard-Morgan and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.\r\n\r\nReview for 2D Version Only.\r\n\r\nSylvester Stallone' 1995 attempt at bringing Judge Dredd to the big screen was met with a critical mauling, both professionally and by serious fans of the 2000AD comic books from whence the character came. On its own terms it's a fun popcorn piece, but one that totally missed the fascist grime of the source. Here however, under the guidance of Travis and Garland, Dredd gets the picture the fans and the character deserves.\r\n\r\nPlot is simple, we are in a dystopian future in a place known as Mega-City One. The only law and order are the Judges who are able to act as judge, jury and executioner. One such feared judge is Judge Dredd (Urban) and when he and his partner in training, Anderson (Thirlby), answer a call to a triple homicide at the multi storey slum tenement known as Peach Trees, they are locked in by crime boss Ma-Ma (Headey) and forced to defend themselves against practically everyone who resides there.\r\n\r\nThis is stripped down to the essence of what makes Judge Dredd such a beloved character in comic book lore. There's no need for backstories, love interests or comedy side-kicks, this is bad ass characters from either side of the law going at it full throttle. The action is unrelenting and explosive in its construction, bloody and brutal into the bargain as well.\r\n\r\nDredd the character is rightly kept to a basic level, he's a hard dude in a suit and helmet, with an arsenal of weapons upon his person and he delivers short sharp shock pieces of dialogue with gruff assertiveness. Anderson is a mutant of sorts, she can read minds, which superbly adds spice to this fight for survival narrative. Ma-Ma is a damaged villain, disgustingly menacing without histrionics, it's her calmness that's so terrifying.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the criminal activities fronted by Ma-Ma is a new drug called Slo-Mo, a drug that reduces the brain's perception to 1% of speed. This allows the makers to bring some dazzling effects into play whilst setting up some blood letting scenarios. The production design is top draw, where Mega-City One has a perfect totalitarianism sheen to it, which in turn is boosted by Dod Mantle's excellent colour lenses.\r\n\r\nWith Urban perfectly cast and his two lady co-stars also firing, Dredd is a thrilling action sci-fi movie. It doesn't push new boundaries and raise the bar per se, but it keeps the fires well and truly burning in the genre whilst appeasing the fans wholesale. 8/10",
            "I used to read the comics when I was young, and they were simple, straightforward shoot 'em ups with \"Dredd\" the epitome of tough, no-nonsense law enforcement in a futuristic environment where crime, violence, poverty and unemployment were pretty normal for many people. This time, Karl Urban takes the title role as the policeman/judge/jury type, and he and his rookie \"Anderson\" (Olivia Thirlby) investigate a few dead bodies in the lobby of an hundred-odd storey building controlled by the drug dealing matriarch \"Ma-Ma\" (Lena Headey) and her menacing henchmen. To begin with, they must find the killer and get out alive - but when some of his own kind arrive and turn against him - and his partner is captured - he sets out to settle this once and for all. Yep, the dialogue is shocking; the acting only little better (Headey is about as menacing as yesterday's creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e) but that's not the point. It's meant to be a brutal action adventure - loads of pyrotechnics, attitude, gun-battles (with some great weapons, btw) that is just aimless fun. That's what is says on the tin, and that's what is does. Never any doubt about the ending, but the route is what it's all about - and for me, anyway, it's just 90 minutes of mindless escapism with a bit of mind-reading thrown in for good measure. Not everything can be Jane Austen - aim low and you ought not to be too disappointed."
